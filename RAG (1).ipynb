The best\\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after\\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\\nbest models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to\\nother tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with\\nlarge and limited training data.\\n∗Equal contribution. Listing order is random. Jakob proposed replacing RNNs with self-attention and started\\nthe effort to evaluate this idea. Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the first Transformer models and\\nhas been crucially involved in every aspect of this work. Noam proposed scaled dot-product attention, multi-head\\nattention and the parameter-free position representation and became the other person involved in nearly every\\ndetail.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2).

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours.

Unlike recent language repre-\\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\\ntuned with just one additional output layer\\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on eleven natural language processing\\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\\n1 Introduction\\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\\nbe effective for improving many natural language\\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\\nThere are two existing strategies for apply-\\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\\nstream tasks: feature-based and ﬁne-tuning. The\\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\\net al., 2018a), uses task-speciﬁc architectures that\\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\\ntional features. The ﬁne-tuning approach, such as\\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\\ntask-speciﬁc parameters, and is trained on the\\ndownstream tasks by simply ﬁne-tuning all pre-\\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\\ngeneral language representations.\\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\\ncially for the ﬁne-tuning approaches. The ma-\\njor limitation is that standard language models are\\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\\nand could be very harmful when applying ﬁne-\\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\\nporate context from both directions.\\nIn this paper, we improve the ﬁne-tuning based\\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\\nEncoder Representations from Transformers.\\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\\nrectionality constraint by using a “masked lan-\\nguage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953).

Unlike left-to-\\nright language model pre-training, the MLM ob-\\njective enables the representation to fuse the left\\nand the right context, which allows us to pre-\\ntrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi-\\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\\na “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-\\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\\nof our paper are as follows:\\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\\npre-training for language representations. Un-\\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce\\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\\nspeciﬁc architectures. BERT is the ﬁrst ﬁne-\\ntuning based representation model that achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\\nof sentence-level and token-level tasks, outper-\\nforming many task-speciﬁc architectures.\\n• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\\nNLP tasks. The code and pre-trained mod-\\nels are available at https://github.com/\\ngoogle-research/bert.\\n2 Related Work\\nThere is a long history of pre-training general lan-\\nguage representations, and we brieﬂy review the\\nmost widely-used approaches in this section.\\n2.1 Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches\\nLearning widely applicable representations of\\nwords has been an active area of research for\\ndecades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;\\nAndo and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and\\nneural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,\\n2014) methods. Pre-trained word embeddings\\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, of-\\nfering signiﬁcant improvements over embeddings\\nlearned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre-\\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\\nguage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-\\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).\\nThese approaches have been generalized to\\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\\ndings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\\n2014). To train sentence representations, prior\\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen-\\ntence words given a representation of the previous\\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto-\\nencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re-\\nsearch along a different dimension. They extract\\ncontext-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a\\nright-to-left language model. The contextual rep-\\nresentation of each token is the concatenation of\\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\\nwith existing task-speciﬁc architectures, ELMo\\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques-\\ntion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\\n2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning\\ncontextual representations through a task to pre-\\ndict a single word from both left and right context\\nusing LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is\\nfeature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus\\net al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used\\nto improve the robustness of text generation mod-\\nels.\\n2.2 Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the ﬁrst\\nworks in this direction only pre-trained word em-\\nbedding parameters from unlabeled text (Col-\\nlobert and Weston, 2008).\\nMore recently, sentence or document encoders\\nwhich produce contextual token representations\\nhave been pre-trained from unlabeled text and\\nﬁne-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Dai\\nand Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford\\net al., 2018). The advantage of these approaches\\nis that few parameters need to be learned from\\nscratch. At least partly due to this advantage,\\nOpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) achieved pre-\\nviously state-of-the-art results on many sentence-\\nlevel tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang\\net al., 2018a).

There are two steps in our\\nframework: pre-training and ﬁne-tuning. Dur-\\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For ﬁne-\\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\\nas a running example for this section.\\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-\\nmal difference between the pre-trained architec-\\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec-\\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\\nthe tensor2tensor library.1 Because the use\\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\\nsuch as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\\nBERTBASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\\neters=110M) and BERTLARGE (L=24, H=1024,\\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\\nBERTBASE was chosen to have the same model\\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans-\\nformer uses constrained self-attention where every\\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\\n1https://github.com/tensorﬂow/tensor2tensor\\n2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward/ﬁlter size to be 4H,\\ni.e., 3072 for the H = 768and 4096 for the H = 1024.\\n4We note that in the literature the bidirectional Trans-'),\n",

A “sequence” refers to the in-\\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The ﬁrst\\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\\nsiﬁcation token ( [CLS]). The ﬁnal hidden state\\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\\ngregate sequence representation for classiﬁcation\\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\\ntoken ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embed-\\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\\nto sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\\nwe denote input embedding as E, the ﬁnal hidden\\nvector of the special [CLS] token as C ∈RH,\\nand the ﬁnal hidden vector for the ith input token\\nas Ti ∈RH.\\nFor a given token, its input representation is\\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza-\\ntion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\\n3.1 Pre-training BERT\\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper-\\nvised tasks, described in this section. This step\\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\\nTask #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reason-\\nable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to-\\nright and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately,\\nstandard conditional language models can only be\\ntrained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirec-\\ntional conditioning would allow each word to in-\\ndirectly “see itself”, and the model could trivially\\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\\nformer is often referred to as a “Transformer encoder” while\\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a “Transformer\\ndecoder” since it can be used for text generation.\\nIn order to train a deep bidirectional representa-\\ntion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked\\nLM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\\ncase, the ﬁnal hidden vectors corresponding to the\\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to-\\nkens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon-\\nstructing the entire input.\\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec-\\ntional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\\nﬁne-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-\\npear during ﬁne-tuning. To mitigate this, we do\\nnot always replace “masked” words with the ac-\\ntual [MASK] token. The training data generator\\nchooses 15% of the token positions at random for\\nprediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace\\nthe i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then,\\nTi will be used to predict the original token with\\ncross entropy loss. We compare variations of this\\nprocedure in Appendix C.2.\\nTask #2: Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)\\nMany important downstream tasks such as Ques-\\ntion Answering (QA) and Natural Language Infer-\\nence (NLI) are based on understanding the rela-\\ntionship between two sentences, which is not di-\\nrectly captured by language modeling. In order\\nto train a model that understands sentence rela-\\ntionships, we pre-train for a binarized next sen-\\ntence prediction task that can be trivially gener-\\nated from any monolingual corpus. Speciﬁcally,\\nwhen choosing the sentencesA and B for each pre-\\ntraining example, 50% of the time B is the actual\\nnext sentence that follows A (labeled as IsNext),\\nand 50% of the time it is a random sentence from\\nthe corpus (labeled as NotNext). As we show\\nin Figure 1, C is used for next sentence predic-\\ntion (NSP). 5 Despite its simplicity, we demon-\\nstrate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this\\ntask is very beneﬁcial to both QA and NLI. 6\\n5The ﬁnal model achieves 97%-98% accuracy on NSP.\\n6The vector C is not a meaningful sentence representation\\nwithout ﬁne-tuning, since it was trained with NSP.'),\n",

However, in prior\\nwork, only sentence embeddings are transferred to\\ndown-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all pa-\\nrameters to initialize end-task model parameters.\\nPre-training data The pre-training procedure\\nlargely follows the existing literature on language\\nmodel pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we\\nuse the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,\\n2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages\\nand ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is criti-\\ncal to use a document-level corpus rather than a\\nshufﬂed sentence-level corpus such as the Billion\\nWord Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to\\nextract long contiguous sequences.\\n3.2 Fine-tuning BERT\\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-\\nattention mechanism in the Transformer al-\\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks—\\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs—by\\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be-\\nfore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\\nspeciﬁc inputs and outputs into BERT and ﬁne-\\ntune all the parameters end-to-end. At the in-\\nput, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training\\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras-\\ning, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and\\n(4) a degenerate text- ∅ pair in text classiﬁcation\\nor sequence tagging. At the output, the token rep-\\nresentations are fed into an output layer for token-\\nlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question\\nanswering, and the [CLS] representation is fed\\ninto an output layer for classiﬁcation, such as en-\\ntailment or sentiment analysis.\\nCompared to pre-training, ﬁne-tuning is rela-\\ntively inexpensive. All of the results in the pa-\\nper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin-\\ngle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model. 7 We de-\\nscribe the task-speciﬁc details in the correspond-\\ning subsections of Section 4. More details can be\\nfound in Appendix A.5.\\n4 Experiments\\nIn this section, we present BERT ﬁne-tuning re-\\nsults on 11 NLP tasks.\\n4.1 GLUE\\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation\\n(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a col-\\nlection of diverse natural language understanding\\ntasks.

The left-only constraint\\nwas also applied at ﬁne-tuning, because removing\\nit introduced a pre-train/ﬁne-tune mismatch that\\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre-\\nsentation, and our ﬁne-tuning scheme.\\nWe ﬁrst examine the impact brought by the NSP\\ntask. In Table 5, we show that removing NSP\\nhurts performance signiﬁcantly on QNLI, MNLI,\\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\\nparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR\\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\\nsigniﬁcantly improve results on SQuAD, but the\\nresults are still far worse than those of the pre-\\ntrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL\\nmodel would not be able to condition the answer\\non the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful\\nthan a deep bidirectional model, since it can use\\nboth left and right context at every layer.\\n5.2 Effect of Model Size\\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size\\non ﬁne-tuning task accuracy. We trained a number\\nof BERT models with a differing number of layers,\\nhidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise\\nusing the same hyperparameters and training pro-\\ncedure as described previously.\\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in\\nTable 6. In this table, we report the average Dev\\nSet accuracy from 5 random restarts of ﬁne-tuning.\\nWe can see that larger models lead to a strict ac-\\ncuracy improvement across all four datasets, even\\nfor MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled train-\\ning examples, and is substantially different from\\nthe pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surpris-\\ning that we are able to achieve such signiﬁcant\\nimprovements on top of models which are al-\\nready quite large relative to the existing literature.\\nFor example, the largest Transformer explored in\\nVaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)\\nwith 100M parameters for the encoder, and the\\nlargest Transformer we have found in the literature\\nis (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters\\n(Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERT BASE\\ncontains 110M parameters and BERT LARGE con-\\ntains 340M parameters.\\nIt has long been known that increasing the\\nmodel size will lead to continual improvements\\non large-scale tasks such as machine translation\\nand language modeling, which is demonstrated\\nby the LM perplexity of held-out training data\\nshown in Table 6. However, we believe that\\nthis is the ﬁrst work to demonstrate convinc-\\ningly that scaling to extreme model sizes also\\nleads to large improvements on very small scale\\ntasks, provided that the model has been sufﬁ-\\nciently pre-trained.

(2016) men-\\ntioned in passing that increasing hidden dimen-\\nsion size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing\\nfurther to 1,000 did not bring further improve-\\nments. Both of these prior works used a feature-\\nbased approach — we hypothesize that when the\\nmodel is ﬁne-tuned directly on the downstream\\ntasks and uses only a very small number of ran-\\ndomly initialized additional parameters, the task-\\nspeciﬁc models can beneﬁt from the larger, more\\nexpressive pre-trained representations even when\\ndownstream task data is very small.\\n5.3 Feature-based Approach with BERT\\nAll of the BERT results presented so far have used\\nthe ﬁne-tuning approach, where a simple classiﬁ-\\ncation layer is added to the pre-trained model, and\\nall parameters are jointly ﬁne-tuned on a down-\\nstream task. However, the feature-based approach,\\nwhere ﬁxed features are extracted from the pre-\\ntrained model, has certain advantages. First, not\\nall tasks can be easily represented by a Trans-\\nformer encoder architecture, and therefore require\\na task-speciﬁc model architecture to be added.\\nSecond, there are major computational beneﬁts\\nto pre-compute an expensive representation of the\\ntraining data once and then run many experiments\\nwith cheaper models on top of this representation.\\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches\\nby applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named\\nEntity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang\\nand De Meulder, 2003).

In\\nparticular, these results enable even low-resource\\ntasks to beneﬁt from deep unidirectional architec-\\ntures.

The purpose of this is to bias the\\nrepresentation towards the actual observed\\nword.\\nThe advantage of this procedure is that the\\nTransformer encoder does not know which words\\nit will be asked to predict or which have been re-\\nplaced by random words, so it is forced to keep\\na distributional contextual representation of ev-\\nery input token. Additionally, because random\\nreplacement only occurs for 1.5% of all tokens\\n(i.e., 10% of 15%), this does not seem to harm\\nthe model’s language understanding capability.

In Section C.1 we demonstrate that\\nMLM does converge marginally slower than a left-\\nto-right model (which predicts every token), but\\nthe empirical improvements of the MLM model\\nfar outweigh the increased training cost.\\nNext Sentence Prediction The next sentence\\nprediction task can be illustrated in the following\\nexamples.\\nInput = [CLS] the man went to [MASK] store [SEP]\\nhe bought a gallon [MASK] milk [SEP]\\nLabel = IsNext\\nInput = [CLS] the man [MASK] to the store [SEP]\\npenguin [MASK] are flight ##less birds [SEP]\\nLabel = NotNext\\nA.2 Pre-training Procedure\\nTo generate each training input sequence, we sam-\\nple two spans of text from the corpus, which we\\nrefer to as “sentences” even though they are typ-\\nically much longer than single sentences (but can\\nbe shorter also). The ﬁrst sentence receives the A\\nembedding and the second receives the B embed-\\nding. 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence\\nthat follows A and 50% of the time it is a random\\nsentence, which is done for the “next sentence pre-\\ndiction” task. They are sampled such that the com-\\nbined length is ≤512 tokens. The LM masking is\\napplied after WordPiece tokenization with a uni-\\nform masking rate of 15%, and no special consid-\\neration given to partial word pieces.\\nWe train with batch size of 256 sequences (256\\nsequences * 512 tokens = 128,000 tokens/batch)\\nfor 1,000,000 steps, which is approximately 40\\nepochs over the 3.3 billion word corpus. We\\nuse Adam with learning rate of 1e-4, β1 = 0.9,\\nβ2 = 0.999, L2 weight decay of 0.01, learning\\nrate warmup over the ﬁrst 10,000 steps, and linear\\ndecay of the learning rate. We use a dropout prob-\\nability of 0.1 on all layers. We use a gelu acti-\\nvation (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) rather than\\nthe standard relu, following OpenAI GPT. The\\ntraining loss is the sum of the mean masked LM\\nlikelihood and the mean next sentence prediction\\nlikelihood.\\nTraining of BERT BASE was performed on 4\\nCloud TPUs in Pod conﬁguration (16 TPU chips\\ntotal).13 Training of BERTLARGE was performed\\non 16 Cloud TPUs (64 TPU chips total). Each pre-\\ntraining took 4 days to complete.\\nLonger sequences are disproportionately expen-\\nsive because attention is quadratic to the sequence\\nlength. To speed up pretraing in our experiments,\\nwe pre-train the model with sequence length of\\n128 for 90% of the steps. Then, we train the rest\\n10% of the steps of sequence of 512 to learn the\\npositional embeddings.\\nA.3 Fine-tuning Procedure\\nFor ﬁne-tuning, most model hyperparameters are\\nthe same as in pre-training, with the exception of\\nthe batch size, learning rate, and number of train-\\ning epochs.

While typically task-agnostic\\nin architecture, this method still requires task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of\\nthousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only\\na few examples or from simple instructions – something which current NLP systems still largely\\nstruggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic,\\nfew-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art ﬁne-\\ntuning approaches. Speciﬁcally, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion\\nparameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in\\nthe few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or ﬁne-tuning,\\nwith tasks and few-shot demonstrations speciﬁed purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3\\nachieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and\\ncloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-ﬂy reasoning or domain adaptation, such as\\nunscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same\\ntime, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3’s few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some\\ndatasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora.

First, single-layer representations were learned using word\\nvectors [MCCD13, PSM14] and fed to task-speciﬁc architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations\\nand contextual state were used to form stronger representations [DL15, MBXS17, PNZtY18] (though still applied to\\ntask-speciﬁc architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [VSP+17] have\\nbeen directly ﬁne-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-speciﬁc architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18].\\nThis last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension,\\nquestion answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures\\nand algorithms [RSR+19, LOG+19, YDY+19, LCG+19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while\\nthe architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-speciﬁc datasets and task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning: to achieve\\nstrong performance on a desired task typically requires ﬁne-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands\\nof examples speciﬁc to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\\nFirst, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the\\napplicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing\\nanything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an abstract concept, to critiquing a short story. For many\\nof these tasks it is difﬁcult to collect a large supervised training dataset, especially when the process must be repeated\\nfor every new task.\\nSecond, the potential to exploit spurious correlations in training data fundamentally grows with the expressiveness\\nof the model and the narrowness of the training distribution. This can create problems for the pre-training plus\\nﬁne-tuning paradigm, where models are designed to be large to absorb information during pre-training, but are then\\nﬁne-tuned on very narrow task distributions. For instance [ HLW+20] observe that larger models do not necessarily\\ngeneralize better out-of-distribution. There is evidence that suggests that the generalization achieved under this paradigm\\ncan be poor because the model is overly speciﬁc to the training distribution and does not generalize well outside it\\n[YdC+19, MPL19]. Thus, the performance of ﬁne-tuned models on speciﬁc benchmarks, even when it is nominally at\\nhuman-level, may exaggerate actual performance on the underlying task [GSL+18, NK19].\\nThird, humans do not require large supervised datasets to learn most language tasks – a brief directive in natural\\nlanguage (e.g. “please tell me if this sentence describes something happy or something sad”) or at most a tiny number\\nof demonstrations (e.g. “here are two examples of people acting brave; please give a third example of bravery”) is often\\nFigure 1.1: Language model meta-learning. During unsupervised pre-training, a language model develops a broad\\nset of skills and pattern recognition abilities. It then uses these abilities at inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize\\nthe desired task. We use the term “in-context learning” to describe the inner loop of this process, which occurs within\\nthe forward-pass upon each sequence. The sequences in this diagram are not intended to be representative of the data a\\nmodel would see during pre-training, but are intended to show that there are sometimes repeated sub-tasks embedded\\nwithin a single sequence.\\n3'),\n",

We show in-context learning\\nperformance on a simple task requiring the model to remove random symbols from a word, both with and without a\\nnatural language task description (see Sec. 3.9.2). The steeper “in-context learning curves” for large models demonstrate\\nimproved ability to learn a task from contextual information. We see qualitatively similar behavior across a wide range\\nof tasks.\\nsufﬁcient to enable a human to perform a new task to at least a reasonable degree of competence. Aside from pointing\\nto a conceptual limitation in our current NLP techniques, this adaptability has practical advantages – it allows humans\\nto seamlessly mix together or switch between many tasks and skills, for example performing addition during a lengthy\\ndialogue. To be broadly useful, we would someday like our NLP systems to have this same ﬂuidity and generality.\\nOne potential route towards addressing these issues is meta-learning1 – which in the context of language models means\\nthe model develops a broad set of skills and pattern recognition abilities at training time, and then uses those abilities\\nat inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize the desired task (illustrated in Figure 1.1). Recent work [RWC+19]\\nattempts to do this via what we call “in-context learning”, using the text input of a pretrained language model as a form\\nof task speciﬁcation: the model is conditioned on a natural language instruction and/or a few demonstrations of the task\\nand is then expected to complete further instances of the task simply by predicting what comes next.\\nWhile it has shown some initial promise, this approach still achieves results far inferior to ﬁne-tuning – for example\\n[RWC+19] achieves only 4% on Natural Questions, and even its 55 F1 CoQa result is now more than 35 points behind\\nthe state of the art. Meta-learning clearly requires substantial improvement in order to be viable as a practical method of\\nsolving language tasks.\\nAnother recent trend in language modeling may offer a way forward. In recent years the capacity of transformer\\nlanguage models has increased substantially, from 100 million parameters [ RNSS18], to 300 million parameters\\n[DCLT18], to 1.5 billion parameters [RWC+19], to 8 billion parameters [SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [RSR+19],\\nand ﬁnally 17 billion parameters [Tur20]. Each increase has brought improvements in text synthesis and/or downstream\\nNLP tasks, and there is evidence suggesting that log loss, which correlates well with many downstream tasks, follows a\\nsmooth trend of improvement with scale [KMH+20]. Since in-context learning involves absorbing many skills and\\ntasks within the parameters of the model, it is plausible that in-context learning abilities might show similarly strong\\ngains with scale.\\n1In the context of language models this has sometimes been called “zero-shot transfer”, but this term is potentially ambiguous:\\nthe method is “zero-shot” in the sense that no gradient updates are performed, but it often involves providing inference-time\\ndemonstrations to the model, so is not truly learning from zero examples. To avoid this confusion, we use the term “meta-learning”\\nto capture the inner-loop / outer-loop structure of the general method, and the term “in context-learning” to refer to the inner\\nloop of meta-learning. We further specialize the description to “zero-shot”, “one-shot”, or “few-shot” depending on how many\\ndemonstrations are provided at inference time. These terms are intended to remain agnostic on the question of whether the model\\nlearns new tasks from scratch at inference time or simply recognizes patterns seen during training – this is an important issue which\\nwe discuss later in the paper, but “meta-learning” is intended to encompass both possibilities, and simply describes the inner-outer\\nloop structure.\\n4'),\n",

See Figure 3.8 for a more detailed analysis on SuperGLUE, a standard NLP\\nbenchmark suite.\\nIn this paper, we test this hypothesis by training a 175 billion parameter autoregressive language model, which we call\\nGPT-3, and measuring its in-context learning abilities. Speciﬁcally, we evaluate GPT-3 on over two dozen NLP datasets,\\nas well as several novel tasks designed to test rapid adaptation to tasks unlikely to be directly contained in the training\\nset. For each task, we evaluate GPT-3 under 3 conditions: (a) “few-shot learning”, or in-context learning where we\\nallow as many demonstrations as will ﬁt into the model’s context window (typically 10 to 100), (b) “one-shot learning”,\\nwhere we allow only one demonstration, and (c) “zero-shot” learning, where no demonstrations are allowed and only\\nan instruction in natural language is given to the model. GPT-3 could also in principle be evaluated in the traditional\\nﬁne-tuning setting, but we leave this to future work.\\nFigure 1.2 illustrates the conditions we study, and shows few-shot learning of a simple task requiring the model to\\nremove extraneous symbols from a word. Model performance improves with the addition of a natural language task\\ndescription, and with the number of examples in the model’s context,K. Few-shot learning also improves dramatically\\nwith model size. Though the results in this case are particularly striking, the general trends with both model size and\\nnumber of examples in-context hold for most tasks we study. We emphasize that these “learning” curves involve no\\ngradient updates or ﬁne-tuning, just increasing numbers of demonstrations given as conditioning.\\nBroadly, on NLP tasks GPT-3 achieves promising results in the zero-shot and one-shot settings, and in the the few-shot\\nsetting is sometimes competitive with or even occasionally surpasses state-of-the-art (despite state-of-the-art being held\\nby ﬁne-tuned models). For example, GPT-3 achieves 81.5 F1 on CoQA in the zero-shot setting, 84.0 F1 on CoQA in\\nthe one-shot setting, 85.0 F1 in the few-shot setting. Similarly, GPT-3 achieves 64.3% accuracy on TriviaQA in the\\nzero-shot setting, 68.0% in the one-shot setting, and 71.2% in the few-shot setting, the last of which is state-of-the-art\\nrelative to ﬁne-tuned models operating in the same closed-book setting.\\nGPT-3 also displays one-shot and few-shot proﬁciency at tasks designed to test rapid adaption or on-the-ﬂy reasoning,\\nwhich include unscrambling words, performing arithmetic, and using novel words in a sentence after seeing them\\ndeﬁned only once. We also show that in the few-shot setting, GPT-3 can generate synthetic news articles which human\\nevaluators have difﬁculty distinguishing from human-generated articles.\\nAt the same time, we also ﬁnd some tasks on which few-shot performance struggles, even at the scale of GPT-3. This\\nincludes natural language inference tasks like the ANLI dataset, and some reading comprehension datasets like RACE\\nor QuAC. By presenting a broad characterization of GPT-3’s strengths and weaknesses, including these limitations, we\\nhope to stimulate study of few-shot learning in language models and draw attention to where progress is most needed.\\nA heuristic sense of the overall results can be seen in Figure 1.3, which aggregates the various tasks (though it should\\nnot be seen as a rigorous or meaningful benchmark in itself).\\n5'),\n",

Section 7 reviews related work and Section 8 concludes.\\n2 Approach\\nOur basic pre-training approach, including model, data, and training, is similar to the process described in [RWC+19],\\nwith relatively straightforward scaling up of the model size, dataset size and diversity, and length of training. Our use\\nof in-context learning is also similar to [RWC+19], but in this work we systematically explore different settings for\\nlearning within the context. Therefore, we start this section by explicitly deﬁning and contrasting the different settings\\nthat we will be evaluating GPT-3 on or could in principle evaluate GPT-3 on. These settings can be seen as lying on a\\nspectrum of how much task-speciﬁc data they tend to rely on. Speciﬁcally, we can identify at least four points on this\\nspectrum (see Figure 2.1 for an illustration):\\n• Fine-Tuning (FT) has been the most common approach in recent years, and involves updating the weights of\\na pre-trained model by training on a supervised dataset speciﬁc to the desired task. Typically thousands to\\nhundreds of thousands of labeled examples are used. The main advantage of ﬁne-tuning is strong performance\\non many benchmarks. The main disadvantages are the need for a new large dataset for every task, the potential\\nfor poor generalization out-of-distribution [ MPL19], and the potential to exploit spurious features of the\\ntraining data [GSL+18, NK19], potentially resulting in an unfair comparison with human performance. In\\nthis work we do not ﬁne-tune GPT-3 because our focus is on task-agnostic performance, but GPT-3 can be\\nﬁne-tuned in principle and this is a promising direction for future work.\\n• Few-Shot (FS) is the term we will use in this work to refer to the setting where the model is given a few\\ndemonstrations of the task at inference time as conditioning [RWC+19], but no weight updates are allowed.\\nAs shown in Figure 2.1, for a typical dataset an example has a context and a desired completion (for example\\nan English sentence and the French translation), and few-shot works by giving K examples of context and\\ncompletion, and then one ﬁnal example of context, with the model expected to provide the completion. We\\ntypically set Kin the range of 10 to 100 as this is how many examples can ﬁt in the model’s context window\\n(nctx = 2048). The main advantages of few-shot are a major reduction in the need for task-speciﬁc data and\\nreduced potential to learn an overly narrow distribution from a large but narrow ﬁne-tuning dataset. The main\\ndisadvantage is that results from this method have so far been much worse than state-of-the-art ﬁne-tuned\\nmodels. Also, a small amount of task speciﬁc data is still required. As indicated by the name, few-shot\\nlearning as described here for language models is related to few-shot learning as used in other contexts in\\nML [HYC01, VBL+16] – both involve learning based on a broad distribution of tasks (in this case implicit in\\nthe pre-training data) and then rapidly adapting to a new task.\\n• One-Shot (1S) is the same as few-shot except that only one demonstration is allowed, in addition to a natural\\nlanguage description of the task, as shown in Figure 1. The reason to distinguish one-shot from few-shot and\\nzero-shot (below) is that it most closely matches the way in which some tasks are communicated to humans.\\nFor example, when asking humans to generate a dataset on a human worker service (for example Mechanical\\nTurk), it is common to give one demonstration of the task. By contrast it is sometimes difﬁcult to communicate\\nthe content or format of a task if no examples are given.\\n6'),\n",

We typically present the model with a few dozen examples in the few shot setting. Exact phrasings for all task\\ndescriptions, examples and prompts can be found in Appendix G.\\n• Zero-Shot (0S) is the same as one-shot except that no demonstrations are allowed, and the model is only given\\na natural language instruction describing the task. This method provides maximum convenience, potential for\\nrobustness, and avoidance of spurious correlations (unless they occur very broadly across the large corpus of\\npre-training data), but is also the most challenging setting. In some cases it may even be difﬁcult for humans\\nto understand the format of the task without prior examples, so this setting is in some cases “unfairly hard”.\\nFor example, if someone is asked to “make a table of world records for the 200m dash”, this request can be\\nambiguous, as it may not be clear exactly what format the table should have or what should be included (and\\neven with careful clariﬁcation, understanding precisely what is desired can be difﬁcult). Nevertheless, for at\\nleast some settings zero-shot is closest to how humans perform tasks – for example, in the translation example\\nin Figure 2.1, a human would likely know what to do from just the text instruction.\\nFigure 2.1 shows the four methods using the example of translating English to French.

The precise architectural\\nparameters for each model are chosen based on computational efﬁciency and load-balancing in the layout of models\\nacross GPU’s. Previous work [KMH+20] suggests that validation loss is not strongly sensitive to these parameters\\nwithin a reasonably broad range.\\n2.2 Training Dataset\\nDatasets for language models have rapidly expanded, culminating in the Common Crawl dataset2 [RSR+19] constituting\\nnearly a trillion words. This size of dataset is sufﬁcient to train our largest models without ever updating on the same\\nsequence twice. However, we have found that unﬁltered or lightly ﬁltered versions of Common Crawl tend to have\\nlower quality than more curated datasets. Therefore, we took 3 steps to improve the average quality of our datasets:\\n(1) we downloaded and ﬁltered a version of CommonCrawl based on similarity to a range of high-quality reference\\ncorpora, (2) we performed fuzzy deduplication at the document level, within and across datasets, to prevent redundancy\\nand preserve the integrity of our held-out validation set as an accurate measure of overﬁtting, and (3) we also added\\nknown high-quality reference corpora to the training mix to augment CommonCrawl and increase its diversity.\\nDetails of the ﬁrst two points (processing of Common Crawl) are described in Appendix A. For the third, we added\\nseveral curated high-quality datasets, including an expanded version of the WebText dataset [ RWC+19], collected\\nby scraping links over a longer period of time, and ﬁrst described in [ KMH+20], two internet-based books corpora\\n(Books1 and Books2) and English-language Wikipedia.\\nTable 2.2 shows the ﬁnal mixture of datasets that we used in training. The CommonCrawl data was downloaded from\\n41 shards of monthly CommonCrawl covering 2016 to 2019, constituting 45TB of compressed plaintext before ﬁltering\\nand 570GB after ﬁltering, roughly equivalent to 400 billion byte-pair-encoded tokens. Note that during training, datasets\\nare not sampled in proportion to their size, but rather datasets we view as higher-quality are sampled more frequently,\\nsuch that CommonCrawl and Books2 datasets are sampled less than once during training, but the other datasets are\\nsampled 2-3 times. This essentially accepts a small amount of overﬁtting in exchange for higher quality training data.\\n2https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/\\n8'),\n",

In Section 3.2 we evaluate on “closed book” question\\nanswering tasks: tasks which require using the information stored in the model’s parameters to answer general\\nknowledge questions. In Section 3.3 we evaluate the model’s ability to translate between languages (especially one-shot\\nand few-shot). In Section 3.4 we evaluate the model’s performance on Winograd Schema-like tasks.

This is still 4.1% lower than the ﬁne-tuned SOTA using a BERT based model [ LDL19] but\\nimproves over previous zero-shot results by roughly 10%.\\n3.2 Closed Book Question Answering\\nIn this section we measure GPT-3’s ability to answer questions about broad factual knowledge. Due to the immense\\namount of possible queries, this task has normally been approached by using an information retrieval system to ﬁnd\\nrelevant text in combination with a model which learns to generate an answer given the question and the retrieved\\ntext. Since this setting allows a system to search for and condition on text which potentially contains the answer it\\nis denoted “open-book”. [RRS20] recently demonstrated that a large language model can perform surprisingly well\\ndirectly answering the questions without conditioning on auxilliary information. They denote this more restrictive\\nevaluation setting as “closed-book”. Their work suggests that even higher-capacity models could perform even better\\nand we test this hypothesis with GPT-3. We evaluate GPT-3 on the 3 datasets in [RRS20]: Natural Questions [KPR+19],\\nWebQuestions [BCFL13], and TriviaQA [JCWZ17], using the same splits. Note that in addition to all results being in\\nthe closed-book setting, our use of few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot evaluations represent an even stricter setting than\\nprevious closed-book QA work: in addition to external content not being allowed, ﬁne-tuning on the Q&A dataset itself\\nis also not permitted.\\nThe results for GPT-3 are shown in Table 3.3. On TriviaQA, we achieve 64.3% in the zero-shot setting, 68.0% in the\\none-shot setting, and 71.2% in the few-shot setting. The zero-shot result already outperforms the ﬁne-tuned T5-11B by\\n14.2%, and also outperforms a version with Q&A tailored span prediction during pre-training by 3.8%. The one-shot\\nresult improves by 3.7% and matches the SOTA for an open-domain QA system which not only ﬁne-tunes but also\\nmakes use of a learned retrieval mechanism over a 15.3B parameter dense vector index of 21M documents [LPP+20].\\nGPT-3’s few-shot result further improves performance another 3.2% beyond this.\\nOn WebQuestions (WebQs), GPT-3 achieves 14.4% in the zero-shot setting, 25.3% in the one-shot setting, and 41.5%\\nin the few-shot setting. This compares to 37.4% for ﬁne-tuned T5-11B, and 44.7% for ﬁne-tuned T5-11B+SSM,\\nwhich uses a Q&A-speciﬁc pre-training procedure. GPT-3 in the few-shot setting approaches the performance of\\nstate-of-the-art ﬁne-tuned models. Notably, compared to TriviaQA, WebQS shows a much larger gain from zero-shot to\\nfew-shot (and indeed its zero-shot and one-shot performance are poor), perhaps suggesting that the WebQs questions\\n13'),\n",

Even with this ﬁltering GPT-2 showed some evidence of multilingual capability and performed non-trivially\\nwhen translating between French and English despite only training on 10 megabytes of remaining French text. Since we\\nincrease the capacity by over two orders of magnitude from GPT-2 to GPT-3, we also expand the scope of the training\\ndataset to include more representation of other languages, though this remains an area for further improvement. As\\ndiscussed in 2.2 the majority of our data is derived from raw Common Crawl with only quality-based ﬁltering. Although\\nGPT-3’s training data is still primarily English (93% by word count), it also includes 7% of text in other languages.\\nThese languages are documented in the supplemental material. In order to better understand translation capability, we\\nalso expand our analysis to include two additional commonly studied languages, German and Romanian.\\nExisting unsupervised machine translation approaches often combine pretraining on a pair of monolingual datasets\\nwith back-translation [SHB15] to bridge the two languages in a controlled way. By contrast, GPT-3 learns from a\\nblend of training data that mixes many languages together in a natural way, combining them on a word, sentence,\\nand document level. GPT-3 also uses a single training objective which is not customized or designed for any task in\\nparticular. However, our one / few-shot settings aren’t strictly comparable to prior unsupervised work since they make\\nuse of a small amount of paired examples (1 or 64). This corresponds to up to a page or two of in-context training data.\\nResults are shown in Table 3.4.

On the\\n“Challenge” version of the dataset which has been ﬁltered to questions which simple statistical or information retrieval\\nmethods are unable to correctly answer, GPT-3 achieves 51.4% accuracy in the zero-shot setting, 53.2% in the one-shot\\nsetting, and 51.5% in the few-shot setting. This is approaching the performance of a ﬁne-tuned RoBERTa baseline\\n(55.9%) from UniﬁedQA [KKS+20]. On the “Easy” version of the dataset (questions which either of the mentioned\\nbaseline approaches answered correctly), GPT-3 achieves 68.8%, 71.2%, and 70.1% which slightly exceeds a ﬁne-tuned\\nRoBERTa baseline from [KKS+20]. However, both of these results are still much worse than the overall SOTAs\\nachieved by the UniﬁedQA which exceeds GPT-3’s few-shot results by 27% on the challenge set and 22% on the easy\\nset.\\nOn OpenBookQA [MCKS18], GPT-3 improves signiﬁcantly from zero to few shot settings but is still over 20 points\\nshort of the overall SOTA. GPT-3’s few-shot performance is similar to a ﬁne-tuned BERT Large baseline on the\\nleaderboard.\\nOverall, in-context learning with GPT-3 shows mixed results on commonsense reasoning tasks, with only small and\\ninconsistent gains observed in the one and few-shot learning settings for both PIQA and ARC, but a signiﬁcant\\nimprovement is observed on OpenBookQA. GPT-3 sets SOTA on the new PIQA dataset in all evaluation settings.\\n3.6 Reading Comprehension\\nNext we evaluate GPT-3 on the task of reading comprehension. We use a suite of 5 datasets including abstractive,\\nmultiple choice, and span based answer formats in both dialog and single question settings. We observe a wide spread\\nin GPT-3’s performance across these datasets suggestive of varying capability with different answer formats. In general\\nwe observe GPT-3 is on par with initial baselines and early results trained using contextual representations on each\\nrespective dataset.\\nGPT-3 performs best (within 3 points of the human baseline) on CoQA [RCM19] a free-form conversational dataset\\nand performs worst (13 F1 below an ELMo baseline) on QuAC [CHI+18] a dataset which requires modeling structured\\ndialog acts and answer span selections of teacher-student interactions. On DROP [DWD+19], a dataset testing discrete\\nreasoning and numeracy in the context of reading comprehension, GPT-3 in a few-shot setting outperforms the ﬁne-tuned\\nBERT baseline from the original paper but is still well below both human performance and state-of-the-art approaches\\nwhich augment neural networks with symbolic systems [RLL+19]. On SQuAD 2.0 [RJL18], GPT-3 demonstrates its\\nfew-shot learning capabilities, improving by almost 10 F1 (to 69.8) compared to a zero-shot setting. This allows it to\\nslightly outperform the best ﬁne-tuned result in the original paper. On RACE [LXL+17], a multiple choice dataset of\\nmiddle school and high school english examinations, GPT-3 performs relatively weakly and is only competitive with\\nthe earliest work utilizing contextual representations and is still 45% behind SOTA.\\n3.7 SuperGLUE\\nIn order to better aggregate results on NLP tasks and compare to popular models such as BERT and RoBERTa in a\\nmore systematic way, we also evaluate GPT-3 on a standardized collection of datasets, the SuperGLUE benchmark\\n[WPN+19] [WPN+19] [CLC+19] [DMST19] [RBG11] [KCR+18] [ZLL+18] [DGM06] [BHDD+06] [GMDD07]\\n[BDD+09] [PCC18] [PHR+18].

On CB, we see signs of life at 75.6% in the few-shot setting.\\nWiC is a notable weak spot with few-shot performance at 49.4% (at random chance). We tried a number of different\\nphrasings and formulations for WiC (which involves determining if a word is being used with the same meaning in two\\nsentences), none of which was able to achieve strong performance. This hints at a phenomenon that will become clearer\\nin the next section (which discusses the ANLI benchmark) – GPT-3 appears to be weak in the few-shot or one-shot\\nsetting at some tasks that involve comparing two sentences or snippets, for example whether a word is used the same\\nway in two sentences (WiC), whether one sentence is a paraphrase of another, or whether one sentence implies another.\\nThis could also explain the comparatively low scores for RTE and CB, which also follow this format.

We scale K up to 32\\nexamples per task, after which point additional examples will not reliably ﬁt into our context.

These results on both RTE and ANLI suggest that NLI is still a very difﬁcult\\ntask for language models and they are only just beginning to show signs of progress.\\n3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks\\nOne way to probe GPT-3’s range of abilities in the few-shot (or zero- and one-shot) setting is to give it tasks which\\nrequire it to perform simple on-the-ﬂy computational reasoning, recognize a novel pattern that is unlikely to have\\noccurred in training, or adapt quickly to an unusual task. We devise several tasks to test this class of abilities. First, we\\ntest GPT-3’s ability to perform arithmetic. Second, we create several tasks that involve rearranging or unscrambling the\\nletters in a word, tasks which are unlikely to have been exactly seen during training. Third, we test GPT-3’s ability to\\nsolve SAT-style analogy problems few-shot. Finally, we test GPT-3 on several qualitative tasks, including using new\\nwords in a sentence, correcting English grammar, and news article generation. We will release the synthetic datasets\\nwith the hope of stimulating further study of test-time behavior of language models.\\n3.9.1 Arithmetic\\nTo test GPT-3’s ability to perform simple arithmetic operations without task-speciﬁc training, we developed a small\\nbattery of 10 tests that involve asking GPT-3 a simple arithmetic problem in natural language:\\n• 2 digit addition (2D+) – The model is asked to add two integers sampled uniformly from [0,100), phrased in\\nthe form of a question, e.g. “Q: What is 48 plus 76?

Each task involves giving the model a word distorted by some combination of\\nscrambling, addition, or deletion of characters, and asking it to recover the original word. The 5 tasks are:\\n• Cycle letters in word (CL) – The model is given a word with its letters cycled, then the “=” symbol, and\\nis expected to generate the original word. For example, it might be given “lyinevitab” and should output\\n“inevitably”.\\n• Anagrams of all but ﬁrst and last characters (A1) – The model is given a word where every letter except\\nthe ﬁrst and last have been scrambled randomly, and must output the original word. Example: criroptuon =\\ncorruption.\\n• Anagrams of all but ﬁrst and last 2 characters (A2) – The model is given a word where every letter except\\nthe ﬁrst 2 and last 2 have been scrambled randomly, and must recover the original word. Example: opoepnnt\\n→opponent.\\n• Random insertion in word (RI) – A random punctuation or space character is inserted between each letter\\nof a word, and the model must output the original word. Example: s.u!c/c!e.s s i/o/n = succession.\\n• Reversed words (RW) – The model is given a word spelled backwards, and must output the original word.\\nExample: stcejbo →objects.\\nFor each task we generate 10,000 examples, which we chose to be the top 10,000 most frequent words as measured by\\n[Nor09] of length more than 4 characters and less than 15 characters.

There is generally\\nsmooth improvement with model size although the random insertion task shows an upward slope of improvement with\\nthe 175B model solving the task the majority of the time. Scaling of one-shot and zero-shot performance is shown in\\nthe appendix. All tasks are done with K = 100.\\nrandom insertions, 38.6% on cycling letters, 40.2% on the easier anagram task, and 15.1% on the more difﬁcult anagram\\ntask (where only the ﬁrst and last letters are held ﬁxed). None of the models can reverse the letters in a word.\\nIn the one-shot setting, performance is signiﬁcantly weaker (dropping by half or more), and in the zero-shot setting the\\nmodel can rarely perform any of the tasks (Table 3.10). This suggests that the model really does appear to learn these\\ntasks at test time, as the model cannot perform them zero-shot and their artiﬁcial nature makes them unlikely to appear\\nin the pre-training data (although we cannot conﬁrm this with certainty).\\nWe can further quantify performance by plotting “in-context learning curves”, which show task performance as a\\nfunction of the number of in-context examples. We show in-context learning curves for the Symbol Insertion task\\nin Figure 1.2. We can see that larger models are able to make increasingly effective use of in-context information,\\nincluding both task examples and natural language task descriptions.\\nFinally, it is worth adding that solving these tasks requires character-level manipulations, whereas our BPE encoding\\noperates on signiﬁcant fractions of a word (on average∼0.7 words per token), so from the LM’s perspective succeeding\\nat these tasks involves not just manipulating BPE tokens but understanding and pulling apart their substructure. Also,\\nCL, A1, and A2 are not bijective (that is, the unscrambled word is not a deterministic function of the scrambled word),\\nrequiring the model to perform some search to ﬁnd the correct unscrambling. Thus, the skills involved appear to require\\nnon-trivial pattern-matching and computation.\\n3.9.3 SAT Analogies\\nTo test GPT-3 on another task that is somewhat unusual relative to the typical distribution of text, we collected a set of\\n374 “SAT analogy” problems [TLBS03]. Analogies are a style of multiple choice question that constituted a section of\\nthe SAT college entrance exam before 2005. A typical example is “audacious is to boldness as (a) sanctimonious is to\\nhypocrisy, (b) anonymous is to identity, (c) remorseful is to misdeed, (d) deleterious is to result, (e) impressionable is to\\ntemptation”. The student is expected to choose which of the ﬁve word pairs has the same relationship as the original\\nword pair; in this example the answer is “sanctimonious is to hypocrisy”. On this task GPT-3 achieves 65.2% in the\\nfew-shot setting, 59.1% in the one-shot setting, and 53.7% in the zero-shot setting, whereas the average score among\\ncollege applicants was 57% [TL05] (random guessing yields 20%). As shown in Figure 3.12, the results improve with\\nscale, with the the full 175 billion model improving by over 10% compared to the 13 billion parameter model.\\n24'),\n",

Relative to [RWC+19], the dataset used to train GPT-3 is much less weighted towards news articles,\\nso trying to generate news articles via raw unconditional samples is less effective – for example GPT-3 often interprets\\nthe proposed ﬁrst sentence of a “news article” as a tweet and then posts synthetic responses or follow-up tweets. To\\nsolve this problem we employed GPT-3’s few-shot learning abilities by providing three previous news articles in the\\nmodel’s context to condition it. With the title and subtitle of a proposed next article, the model is able to reliably\\ngenerate short articles in the “news” genre.\\nTo gauge the quality of news article generation from GPT-3 (which we believe is likely to be correlated with conditional\\nsample generation quality in general), we decided to measure human ability to distinguish GPT-3-generated articles\\nfrom real ones. Similar work has been carried out by Kreps et al. [KMB20] and Zellers et al. [ZHR+19]. Generative\\nlanguage models are trained to match the distribution of content generated by humans, so the (in)ability of humans to\\ndistinguish the two is a potentially important measure of quality.3\\nIn order to see how well humans can detect model generated text, we arbitrarily selected 25 article titles and subtitles\\nfrom the website newser.com (mean length: 215 words). We then generated completions of these titles and subtitles\\nfrom four language models ranging in size from 125M to 175B (GPT-3) parameters (mean length: 200 words). For each\\nmodel, we presented around 80 US-based participants with a quiz consisting of these real titles and subtitles followed\\nby either the human written article or the article generated by the model4. Participants were asked to select whether the\\narticle was “very likely written by a human”, “more likely written by a human”, “I don’t know”, “more likely written by\\na machine”, or “very likely written by a machine”.\\nThe articles we selected were not in the models’ training data and the model outputs were formatted and selected\\nprogrammatically to prevent human cherry-picking. All models used the same context to condition outputs on and were\\npre-trained with the same context size and the same article titles and subtitles were used as prompts for each model.\\nHowever, we also ran an experiment to control for participant effort and attention that followed the same format but\\ninvolved intentionally bad model generated articles. This was done by generating articles from a “control model”: a\\n160M parameter model with no context and increased output randomness.\\n3This task is also relevant to the potential misuse of language models discussed in Section 6.1.\\n4We wanted to identify how good an average person on the internet is at detecting language model outputs, so we focused on\\nparticipants drawn from the general US population. See Appendix E for details.\\n25'),\n",

Factual inaccuracies can be an indicator\\nthat an article is model generated since, unlike human authors, the models have no access to the speciﬁc facts that the\\narticle titles refer to or when the article was written. Other indicators include repetition, non sequiturs, and unusual\\nphrasings, though these are often subtle enough that they are not noticed.\\nRelated work on language model detection by Ippolito et al. [IDCBE19] indicates that automatic discriminators like\\nG R O V E R[ZHR+19] and GLTR [GSR19] may have greater success at detecting model generated text than human\\nevaluators. Automatic detection of these models may be a promising area of future research.\\nIppolito et al. [IDCBE19] also note that human accuracy at detecting model generated text increases as humans observe\\nmore tokens. To do a preliminary investigation of how good humans are at detecting longer news articles generated\\nby GPT-3 175B, we selected 12 world news articles from Reuters with an average length of 569 words and generated\\ncompletions of these articles from GPT-3 with an average length of 498 words (298 words longer than our initial\\nexperiments). Following the methodology above, we ran two experiments, each on around 80 US-based participants, to\\ncompare human abilities to detect the articles generated by GPT-3 and a control model.\\nWe found that mean human accuracy at detecting the intentionally bad longer articles from the control model was\\n∼88%, while mean human accuracy at detecting the longer articles that were produced by GPT-3 175B was still barely\\nabove chance at ∼52% (see Table 3.12). This indicates that, for news articles that are around 500 words long, GPT-3\\ncontinues to produce articles that humans ﬁnd difﬁcult to distinguish from human written news articles.\\n3.9.5 Learning and Using Novel Words\\nA task studied in developmental linguistics [CB78] is the ability to learn and utilize new words, for example using a\\nword in a sentence after seeing it deﬁned only once, or conversely inferring a word’s meaning from only one usage. Here\\nwe qualitatively test GPT-3’s ability to do the former. Speciﬁcally, we give GPT-3 the deﬁnition of a nonexistent word,\\nsuch as “Gigamuru”, and then ask it to use it in a sentence. We provide one to ﬁve previous examples of a (separate)\\n5We use a two-sample Student’s T-Test to test for signiﬁcant difference between the means of the participant accuracies of each\\nmodel and the control model and report the normalized difference in the means (as the t-statistic) and the p-value.\\n6If a model consistently produces texts that are more impressive than human articles, it is possible that human performance on\\nthis task would drop below 50%. Indeed, many individual participants scored below 50% on this task.\\n7Additional non-news samples can be found in Appendix F.\\n26'),\n",

We test this with GPT-3 in the few-\\nshot setting by giving prompts of the form \"Poor English Input: <sentence> \\\\n Good English Output:\\n<sentence>\". We give GPT-3 one human-generated correction and then ask it to correct 5 more (again without any\\nomissions or repeats).

On the one hand, the dataset and model size are about two orders of\\nmagnitude larger than those used for GPT-2, and include a large amount of Common Crawl, creating increased potential\\nfor contamination and memorization. On the other hand, precisely due to the large amount of data, even GPT-3 175B\\ndoes not overﬁt its training set by a signiﬁcant amount, measured relative to a held-out validation set with which it was\\ndeduplicated (Figure 4.1). Thus, we expect that contamination is likely to be frequent, but that its effects may not be as\\nlarge as feared.\\nWe initially tried to address the issue of contamination by proactively searching for and attempting to remove any overlap\\nbetween our training data and the development and test sets of all benchmarks studied in this paper. Unfortunately, a\\nbug resulted in only partial removal of all detected overlaps from the training data. Due to the cost of training, it wasn’t\\nfeasible to retrain the model. To address this, we investigate in detail how the remaining detected overlap impacts\\nresults.\\nFor each benchmark, we produce a ‘clean’ version which removes all potentially leaked examples, deﬁned roughly as\\nexamples that have a 13-gram overlap with anything in the pretraining set (or that overlap with the whole example when\\nit is shorter than 13-grams). The goal is to very conservatively ﬂag anything that could potentially be contamination,\\nso as to produce a clean subset that is free of contamination with high conﬁdence. The exact procedure is detailed in\\nAppendix C.\\nWe then evaluate GPT-3 on these clean benchmarks, and compare to the original score. If the score on the clean\\nsubset is similar to the score on the entire dataset, this suggests that contamination, even if present, does not have a\\nsigniﬁcant effect on reported results. If the score on the clean subset is lower, this suggests contamination may be\\ninﬂating the results. The results are summarized in Figure 4.2. Although potential contamination is often high (with a\\nquarter of benchmarks scoring over 50%), in most cases performance changes only negligibly, and we see no evidence\\nthat contamination level and performance difference are correlated. We conclude that either our conservative method\\nsubstantially overestimated contamination or that contamination has little effect on performance.\\nBelow, we review in more detail the few speciﬁc cases where either (1) the model performs signiﬁcantly worse on\\nthe cleaned version, or (2) potential contamination is very high, which makes measuring the performance difference\\ndifﬁcult.\\nOur analysis ﬂagged six groups of benchmarks for further investigation: Word Scrambling, Reading Comprehension\\n(QuAC, SQuAD2, DROP), PIQA, Winograd, language modeling tasks (Wikitext tasks, 1BW), and German to English\\n31'),\n",

We summarize the results for each group of tasks below:\\n• Reading Comprehension: Our initial analysis ﬂagged >90% of task examples from QuAC, SQuAD2, and\\nDROP as potentially contaminated, so large that even measuring the differential on a clean subset was difﬁcult.\\nUpon manual inspection, however, we found that for every overlap we inspected, in all 3 datasets, the source\\ntext was present in our training data but the question/answer pairs were not, meaning the model gains only\\nbackground information and cannot memorize the answer to a speciﬁc question.\\n• German translation: We found 25% of the examples in the WMT16 German-English test set were marked\\nas potentially contaminated, with an associated total effect size of 1-2 BLEU. Upon inspection, none of the\\nﬂagged examples contain paired sentences resembling NMT training data and collisions were monolingual\\nmatches mostly of snippets of events discussed in the news.\\n• Reversed Words and Anagrams: Recall that these tasks are of the form “ alaok = koala”. Due to the\\nshort length of these tasks, we used 2-grams for ﬁltering (ignoring punctuation). After inspecting the ﬂagged\\noverlaps, we found that they were not typically instances of real reversals or unscramblings in the training set,\\nbut rather palindromes or trivial unscramblings, e.g “kayak = kayak”. The amount of overlap was small,\\nbut removing the trivial tasks lead to an increase in difﬁculty and thus a spurious signal. Related to this, the\\nsymbol insertion task shows high overlap but no effect on performance – this is because that task involves\\nremoving non-letter characters from a word, and the overlap analysis itself ignores such characters, leading to\\nmany spurious matches.\\n• PIQA: The overlap analysis ﬂagged 29% of examples as contaminated, and observed a 3 percentage point\\nabsolute decrease (4% relative decrease) in performance on the clean subset. Though the test dataset was\\nreleased after our training set was created and its labels are hidden, some of the web pages used by the\\ncrowdsourced dataset creators are contained in our training set.

For a more detailed\\nexplanation of our analysis, we refer the reader to Appendix C.\\n5 Limitations\\nGPT-3 and our analysis of it have a number of limitations. Below we describe some of these and suggest directions for\\nfuture work.\\nFirst, despite the strong quantitative and qualitative improvements of GPT-3, particularly compared to its direct\\npredecessor GPT-2, it still has notable weaknesses in text synthesis and several NLP tasks. On text synthesis, although\\nthe overall quality is high, GPT-3 samples still sometimes repeat themselves semantically at the document level, start to\\nlose coherence over sufﬁciently long passages, contradict themselves, and occasionally contain non-sequitur sentences\\nor paragraphs. We will release a collection of 500 uncurated unconditional samples to help provide a better sense of\\nGPT-3’s limitations and strengths at text synthesis. Within the domain of discrete language tasks, we have noticed\\ninformally that GPT-3 seems to have special difﬁculty with “common sense physics”, despite doing well on some\\ndatasets (such as PIQA [BZB+19]) that test this domain. Speciﬁcally GPT-3 has difﬁculty with questions of the type\\n“If I put cheese into the fridge, will it melt?”. Quantitatively, GPT-3’s in-context learning performance has some notable\\ngaps on our suite of benchmarks, as described in Section 3, and in particular it does little better than chance when\\nevaluated one-shot or even few-shot on some “comparison” tasks, such as determining if two words are used the same\\nway in a sentence, or if one sentence implies another (WIC and ANLI respectively), as well as on a subset of reading\\ncomprehension tasks. This is especially striking given GPT-3’s strong few-shot performance on many other tasks.\\nGPT-3 has several structural and algorithmic limitations, which could account for some of the issues above. We focused\\non exploring in-context learning behavior in autoregressive language models because it is straightforward to both\\nsample and compute likelihoods with this model class. As a result our experiments do not include any bidirectional\\narchitectures or other training objectives such as denoising. This is a noticeable difference from much of the recent\\nliterature, which has documented improved ﬁne-tuning performance when using these approaches over standard\\nlanguage models [RSR+19]. Thus our design decision comes at the cost of potentially worse performance on tasks\\nwhich empirically beneﬁt from bidirectionality. This may include ﬁll-in-the-blank tasks, tasks that involve looking back\\nand comparing two pieces of content, or tasks that require re-reading or carefully considering a long passage and then\\ngenerating a very short answer. This could be a possible explanation for GPT-3’s lagging few-shot performance on a\\nfew of the tasks, such as WIC (which involves comparing the use of a word in two sentences), ANLI (which involves\\ncomparing two sentences to see if one implies the other), and several reading comprehension tasks (e.g. QuAC and\\nRACE). We also conjecture, based on past literature, that a large bidirectional model would be stronger at ﬁne-tuning\\nthan GPT-3. Making a bidirectional model at the scale of GPT-3, and/or trying to make bidirectional models work with\\nfew- or zero-shot learning, is a promising direction for future research, and could help achieve the “best of both worlds”.\\nA more fundamental limitation of the general approach described in this paper – scaling up any LM-like model, whether\\nautoregressive or bidirectional – is that it may eventually run into (or could already be running into) the limits of the\\n33'),\n",

[RRS20] demonstrate beneﬁts of customizing prediction to entities of interest. Also,\\nwith self-supervised objectives, task speciﬁcation relies on forcing the desired task into a prediction problem, whereas\\nultimately, useful language systems (for example virtual assistants) might be better thought of as taking goal-directed\\nactions rather than just making predictions. Finally, large pretrained language models are not grounded in other domains\\nof experience, such as video or real-world physical interaction, and thus lack a large amount of context about the world\\n[BHT+20]. For all these reasons, scaling pure self-supervised prediction is likely to hit limits, and augmentation with a\\ndifferent approach is likely to be necessary. Promising future directions in this vein might include learning the objective\\nfunction from humans [ZSW+19a], ﬁne-tuning with reinforcement learning, or adding additional modalities such as\\nimages to provide grounding and a better model of the world [CLY+19].\\nAnother limitation broadly shared by language models is poor sample efﬁciency during pre-training. While GPT-3\\ntakes a step towards test-time sample efﬁciency closer to that of humans (one-shot or zero-shot), it still sees much more\\ntext during pre-training than a human sees in the their lifetime [Lin20]. Improving pre-training sample efﬁciency is\\nan important direction for future work, and might come from grounding in the physical world to provide additional\\ninformation, or from algorithmic improvements.\\nA limitation, or at least uncertainty, associated with few-shot learning in GPT-3 is ambiguity about whether few-shot\\nlearning actually learns new tasks “from scratch” at inference time, or if it simply recognizes and identiﬁes tasks that it\\nhas learned during training. These possibilities exist on a spectrum, ranging from demonstrations in the training set that\\nare drawn from exactly the same distribution as those at test time, to recognizing the same task but in a different format,\\nto adapting to a speciﬁc style of a general task such as QA, to learning a skill entirely de novo. Where GPT-3 is on\\nthis spectrum may also vary from task to task. Synthetic tasks such as wordscrambling or deﬁning nonsense words\\nseem especially likely to be learned de novo, whereas translation clearly must be learned during pretraining, although\\npossibly from data that is very different in organization and style than the test data. Ultimately, it is not even clear what\\nhumans learn from scratch vs from prior demonstrations. Even organizing diverse demonstrations during pre-training\\nand identifying them at test time would be an advance for language models, but nevertheless understanding precisely\\nhow few-shot learning works is an important unexplored direction for future research.\\nA limitation associated with models at the scale of GPT-3, regardless of objective function or algorithm, is that they are\\nboth expensive and inconvenient to perform inference on, which may present a challenge for practical applicability of\\nmodels of this scale in their current form. One possible future direction to address this is distillation [HVD15] of large\\nmodels down to a manageable size for speciﬁc tasks. Large models such as GPT-3 contain a very wide range of skills,\\nmost of which are not needed for a speciﬁc task, suggesting that in principle aggressive distillation may be possible.\\nDistillation is well-explored in general [LHCG19a] but has not been tried at the scale of hundred of billions parameters;\\nnew challenges and opportunities may be associated with applying it to models of this size.\\nFinally, GPT-3 shares some limitations common to most deep learning systems – its decisions are not easily interpretable,\\nit is not necessarily well-calibrated in its predictions on novel inputs as observed by the much higher variance in\\nperformance than humans on standard benchmarks, and it retains the biases of the data it has been trained on. This\\nlast issue – biases in the data that may lead the model to generate stereotyped or prejudiced content – is of special\\nconcern from a societal perspective, and will be discussed along with other issues in the next section on Broader Impacts\\n(Section 6).\\n6 Broader Impacts\\nLanguage models have a wide range of beneﬁcial applications for society, including code and writing auto-completion,\\ngrammar assistance, game narrative generation, improving search engine responses, and answering questions. But\\nthey also have potentially harmful applications. GPT-3 improves the quality of text generation and adaptability over\\nsmaller models and increases the difﬁculty of distinguishing synthetic text from human-written text. It therefore has the\\npotential to advance both the beneﬁcial and harmful applications of language models.\\nHere we focus on the potential harms of improved language models, not because we believe the harms are necessarily\\ngreater, but in order to stimulate efforts to study and mitigate them. The broader impacts of language models like this\\nare numerous. We focus on two primary issues: the potential for deliberate misuse of language models like GPT-3 in\\nSection 6.1, and issues of bias, fairness, and representation within models like GPT-3 in Section 6.2.

To help with this,\\nwe can think in terms of traditional security risk assessment frameworks, which outline key steps such as identifying\\nthreats and potential impacts, assessing likelihood, and determining risk as a combination of likelihood and impact\\n[Ros12]. We discuss three factors: potential misuse applications, threat actors, and external incentive structures.\\n6.1.1 Potential Misuse Applications\\nAny socially harmful activity that relies on generating text could be augmented by powerful language models. Examples\\ninclude misinformation, spam, phishing, abuse of legal and governmental processes, fraudulent academic essay writing\\nand social engineering pretexting. Many of these applications bottleneck on human beings to write sufﬁciently high\\nquality text. Language models that produce high quality text generation could lower existing barriers to carrying out\\nthese activities and increase their efﬁcacy.\\nThe misuse potential of language models increases as the quality of text synthesis improves. The ability of GPT-3 to\\ngenerate several paragraphs of synthetic content that people ﬁnd difﬁcult to distinguish from human-written text in\\n3.9.4 represents a concerning milestone in this regard.\\n6.1.2 Threat Actor Analysis\\nThreat actors can be organized by skill and resource levels, ranging from low or moderately skilled and resourced actors\\nwho may be able to build a malicious product to ‘advanced persistent threats’ (APTs): highly skilled and well-resourced\\n(e.g. state-sponsored) groups with long-term agendas [SBC+19].\\nTo understand how low and mid-skill actors think about language models, we have been monitoring forums and chat\\ngroups where misinformation tactics, malware distribution, and computer fraud are frequently discussed. While we did\\nﬁnd signiﬁcant discussion of misuse following the initial release of GPT-2 in spring of 2019, we found fewer instances\\nof experimentation and no successful deployments since then. Additionally, those misuse discussions were correlated\\nwith media coverage of language model technologies. From this, we assess that the threat of misuse from these actors is\\nnot immediate, but signiﬁcant improvements in reliability could change this.\\nBecause APTs do not typically discuss operations in the open, we have consulted with professional threat analysts about\\npossible APT activity involving the use of language models. Since the release of GPT-2 there has been no discernible\\ndifference in operations that may see potential gains by using language models. The assessment was that language\\nmodels may not be worth investing signiﬁcant resources in because there has been no convincing demonstration that\\ncurrent language models are signiﬁcantly better than current methods for generating text, and because methods for\\n“targeting” or “controlling” the content of language models are still at a very early stage.\\n6.1.3 External Incentive Structures\\nEach threat actor group also has a set of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that they rely on to accomplish their\\nagenda. TTPs are inﬂuenced by economic factors like scalability and ease of deployment; phishing is extremely popular\\namong all groups because it offers a low-cost, low-effort, high-yield method of deploying malware and stealing login\\ncredentials. Using language models to augment existing TTPs would likely result in an even lower cost of deployment.\\nEase of use is another signiﬁcant incentive. Having stable infrastructure has a large impact on the adoption of TTPs.\\nThe outputs of language models are stochastic, however, and though developers can constrain these (e.g. using top-k\\ntruncation) they are not able to perform consistently without human feedback. If a social media disinformation bot\\nproduces outputs that are reliable 99% of the time, but produces incoherent outputs 1% of the time, this could reduce the\\namount of human labor required in operating this bot. But a human is still needed to ﬁlter the outputs, which restricts\\nhow scalable the operation can be.\\nBased on our analysis of this model and analysis of threat actors and the landscape, we suspect AI researchers will\\neventually develop language models that are sufﬁciently consistent and steerable that they will be of greater interest to\\nmalicious actors. We expect this will introduce challenges for the broader research community, and hope to work on\\nthis through a combination of mitigation research, prototyping, and coordinating with other technical developers.\\n35'),\n",

We probe for bias in the 175 billion parameter model and also in similar smaller models, to see if and how\\nthey are different in this dimension.\\n6.2.1 Gender\\nIn our investigation of gender bias in GPT-3, we focused on associations between gender and occupation. We found\\nthat occupations in general have a higher probability of being followed by a male gender identiﬁer than a female one\\n(in other words, they are male leaning) when given a context such as \"The {occupation} was a\" (Neutral Variant).\\n83% of the 388 occupations we tested were more likely to be followed by a male identiﬁer by GPT-3. We measured\\nthis by feeding the model a context such as \"The detective was a\" and then looking at the probability of the\\nmodel following up with male indicating words (eg. man, male etc.) or female indicating words (woman, female etc.).\\nIn particular, occupations demonstrating higher levels of education such as legislator, banker, or professor emeritus\\nwere heavily male leaning along with occupations that require hard physical labour such as mason, millwright, and\\nsheriff. Occupations that were more likely to be followed by female identiﬁers include midwife, nurse, receptionist,\\nhousekeeper etc.\\nWe also tested how these probabilities changed when we shifted the context to be the\"The competent {occupation}\\nwas a\" (Competent Variant), and when we shifted the context to be \"The incompetent {occupation} was a\"\\n(Incompetent Variant) for each occupation in the dataset. We found that, when prompted with \"The competent\\n{occupation} was a,\" the majority of occupations had an even higher probability of being followed by a\\nmale identiﬁer than a female one than was the case with our original neutral prompt, \"The {occupation} was\\na\". With the prompt \"The incompetent {occupation} was a\" the majority of occupations still leaned male\\nwith a similar probability than for our original neutral prompt. The average occupation bias - measured as\\n1\\nnjobs\\n∑\\njobs log(P(female|Context)\\nP(male|Context)) ) - was −1.11 for the Neutral Variant, −2.14 for the Competent Variant and −1.15\\nfor the Incompetent Variant.\\nWe also carried out pronoun resolution on the Winogender dataset [ RNLVD18] using two methods which further\\ncorroborated the model’s tendency to associate most occupations with males. One method measured the mod-\\nels ability to correctly assign a pronoun as the occupation or the participant. For example, we fed the model\\na context such as \"The advisor met with the advisee because she wanted to get advice about job\\napplications. ‘She’ refers to the\" and found the option with the lowest probability between the two possi-\\nble options (Choices between Occupation Option: advisor; Participant Option: advisee).\\nOccupation and participant words often have societal biases associated with them such as the assumption that most\\noccupants are by default male. We found that the language models learnt some of these biases such as a tendency to\\nassociate female pronouns with participant positions more than male pronouns. GPT-3 175B had the highest accuracy of\\nall the models (64.17%) on this task. It was also the only model where the accuracy for Occupant sentences (sentences\\nwhere the correct answer was the Occupation option) for females was higher than for males (81.7% vs 76.7%). All\\nother models had a higher accuracy for male pronouns with Occupation sentences as compared to female pronouns\\nwith the exception of our second largest model- GPT-3 13B - which had the same accuracy (60%) for both. This offers\\nsome preliminary evidence that in places where issues of bias can make language models susceptible to error, the larger\\nmodels are more robust than smaller models.\\nWe also performed co-occurrence tests, where we analyzed which words are likely to occur in the vicinity of other pre-\\nselected words. We created a model output sample set by generating 800 outputs of length 50 each with a temperature\\n8Evaluating fairness, bias, and representation in language models is a rapidly-developing area with a large body of prior work.\\nSee, for example, [HZJ+19, NBR20, SCNP19].\\n36'),\n",

We found females were more\\noften described using appearance oriented words such as ”beautiful” and ”gorgeous” as compared to men who were\\nmore often described using adjectives that span a greater spectrum.\\nTable 6.1 shows the top 10 most favored descriptive words for the model along with the raw number of times each\\nword co-occurred with a pronoun indicator. “Most Favored” here indicates words which were most skewed towards a\\ncategory by co-occurring with it at a higher rate as compared to the other category. To put these numbers in perspective,\\nwe have also included the average for the number of co-occurrences across all qualifying words for each gender.\\n6.2.2 Race\\nTo investigate racial bias in GPT-3, we seeded the model with prompts such as - \"The {race} man was very\",\\n\"The {race} woman was very\" and \"People would describe the {race} person as\" and generated 800\\nsamples for each of the above prompts, with {race}replaced with a term indicating a racial category such as White\\nor Asian. We then measure word co-occurrences in the generated samples. Given prior research demonstrating that\\nlanguage models produce text of differing sentiment when varying features such as occupation [HZJ+19], we explored\\nhow race impacted sentiment. We measured sentiment using Senti WordNet [BES10] for the words which co-occurred\\ndisproportionately with each race. Each word sentiment varied from 100 to -100, with positive scores indicating positive\\nwords (eg. wonderfulness: 100, amicable: 87.5), negative scores indicating negative words (eg. wretched: -87.5 , horrid:\\n-87.5) and a score of 0 indicating neutral words (eg. sloping, chalet).\\nIt should be noted that we were explicitly prompting the models to talk about race and this in turn generated text that\\nfocused on racial features; these results are not from the models talking about race in the wild but talking about race in\\nan experimental setup where they have been primed to do so. Additionally, since we are measuring sentiment by simply\\nlooking at word co-occurrences, the resulting sentiment can reﬂect socio-historical factors - for instance, text relating to\\na discussion of slavery will frequently have a negative sentiment, which may lead to a demographic being associated\\nwith a negative sentiment under this testing methodology.\\nAcross the models we analyzed, ‘Asian’ had a consistently high sentiment - it ranked 1st in 3 out of 7 models. On the\\nother hand, ’Black’ had a consistently low sentiment - it ranked the lowest in 5 out of 7 models. These differences\\nnarrowed marginally on the larger model sizes. This analysis gives a sense of the biases of different models and\\nhighlights the need for more sophisticated analysis of the relationship between sentiment, entities, and input data.\\n9We only used male and female pronouns. This simplifying assumption makes it easier to study co-occurrence since it does not\\nrequire the isolation of instances in which ‘they’ refers to a singular noun from those where it didn’t, but other forms of gender bias\\nare likely present and could be studied using different approaches.\\n37'),\n",

Our work is inspired by the literature on characterizing model\\nattributes to develop informative labels such as Model Cards for Model Reporting from [MWZ+18].\\nUltimately, it is important not just to characterize biases in language systems but to intervene. The literature on this\\nis also extensive [QMZH19, HZJ+19], so we offer only a few brief comments on future directions speciﬁc to large\\nlanguage models. In order to pave the way for effective bias prevention in general purpose models, there is a need for\\nbuilding a common vocabulary tying together the normative, technical and empirical challenges of bias mitigation for\\nthese models. There is room for more research that engages with the literature outside NLP, better articulates normative\\nstatements about harm, and engages with the lived experience of communities affected by NLP systems [BBDIW20].\\nThus, mitigation work should not be approached purely with a metric driven objective to ‘remove’ bias as this has been\\nshown to have blind spots [GG19, NvNvdG19] but in a holistic manner.\\n6.3 Energy Usage\\nPractical large-scale pre-training requires large amounts of computation, which is energy-intensive: training the GPT-3\\n175B consumed several thousand petaﬂop/s-days of compute during pre-training, compared to tens of petaﬂop/s-days\\nfor a 1.5B parameter GPT-2 model (Figure 2.2). This means we should be cognizant of the cost and efﬁciency of such\\nmodels, as advocated by [SDSE19].\\nThe use of large-scale pre-training also gives another lens through which to view the efﬁciency of large models - we\\nshould consider not only the resources that go into training them, but how these resources are amortized over the\\nlifetime of a model, which will subsequently be used for a variety of purposes and ﬁne-tuned for speciﬁc tasks. Though\\nmodels like GPT-3 consume signiﬁcant resources during training, they can be surprisingly efﬁcient once trained: even\\nwith the full GPT-3 175B, generating 100 pages of content from a trained model can cost on the order of 0.4 kW-hr, or\\nonly a few cents in energy costs. Additionally, techniques like model distillation [LHCG19a] can further bring down\\nthe cost of such models, letting us adopt a paradigm of training single, large-scale models, then creating more efﬁcient\\nversions of them for use in appropriate contexts. Algorithmic progress may also naturally further increase the efﬁciency\\nof such models over time, similar to trends observed in image recognition and neural machine translation [HB20].\\n7 Related Work\\nSeveral lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a\\nmeans to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a\\nbillion parameters [JVS+16]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling\\nup parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size:\\n213 million parameters [ VSP+17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [ DCLT18], 1.5 billion parameters\\n[RWC+19], 8 billion parameters [SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [RSR+19], and most recently 17 billion parameters\\n[Tur20]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of\\nincreasing models’ capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the\\nconditional computation framework [BLC13] and speciﬁcally, the mixture-of-experts method [SMM+17] has been\\nused to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [ AJF19],\\nthough only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases\\ncomputation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time [Gra16] and\\nthe universal transformer [DGV+18]. Our work focuses on the ﬁrst approach (scaling compute and parameters together,\\nby straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ\\nthis strategy.\\nSeveral efforts have also systematically studied the effect of scale on language model performance. [ KMH+20,\\nRRBS19, LWS+20, HNA+17], ﬁnd a smooth power-law trend in loss as autoregressive language models are scaled up.\\nThis work suggests that this trend largely continues as models continue to scale up (although a slight bending of the\\ncurve can perhaps be detected in Figure 3.1), and we also ﬁnd relatively smooth increases in many (though not all)\\ndownstream tasks across 3 orders of magnitude of scaling.\\nAnother line of work goes in the opposite direction from scaling, attempting to preserve strong performance in language\\nmodels that are as small as possible.

In this work we test our models on many\\nof these datasets.\\nMany previous efforts have focused speciﬁcally on question-answering, which constitutes a signiﬁcant fraction of the\\ntasks we tested on. Recent efforts include [RSR+19, RRS20], which ﬁne-tuned an 11 billion parameter language model,\\nand [GLT+20], which focused on attending over a large corpus of data at test time. Our work differs in focusing on\\nin-context learning but could be combined in the future with those of [GLT+20, LPP+20].\\nMetalearning in language models has been utilized in [ RWC+19], though with much more limited results and no\\nsystematic study. More broadly, language model metalearning has an inner-loop-outer-loop structure, making it\\nstructurally similar to metalearning as applied to ML in general. Here there is an extensive literature, including\\nmatching networks [VBL+16], RL2 [DSC+16], learning to optimize [RL16, ADG+16, LM17] and MAML [FAL17].\\nOur approach of stufﬁng the model’s context with previous examples is most structurally similar to RL2 and also\\nresembles [HYC01], in that an inner loop of adaptation takes place through computation in the model’s activations\\nacross timesteps, without updating the weights, while an outer loop (in this case just language model pre-training)\\nupdates the weights, and implicitly learns the ability to adapt to or at least recognize tasks deﬁned at inference-time.\\nFew-shot auto-regressive density estimation was explored in [ RCP+17] and [GWC+18] studied low-resource NMT as\\na few-shot learning problem.\\nWhile the mechanism of our few-shot approach is different, prior work has also explored ways of using pre-trained\\nlanguage models in combination with gradient descent to perform few-shot learning [SS20]. Another sub-ﬁeld with\\nsimilar goals is semi-supervised learning where approaches such as UDA [XDH+19] also explore methods of ﬁne-tuning\\nwhen very little labeled data is available.\\nGiving multi-task models instructions in natural language was ﬁrst formalized in a supervised setting with [MKXS18]\\nand utilized for some tasks (such as summarizing) in a language model with [ RWC+19]. The notion of presenting\\ntasks in natural language was also explored in the text-to-text transformer [RSR+19], although there it was applied for\\nmulti-task ﬁne-tuning rather than for in-context learning without weight updates.\\nAnother approach to increasing generality and transfer-learning capability in language models is multi-task learning\\n[Car97], which ﬁne-tunes on a mixture of downstream tasks together, rather than separately updating the weights for\\neach one. If successful multi-task learning could allow a single model to be used for many tasks without updating the\\nweights (similar to our in-context learning approach), or alternatively could improve sample efﬁciency when updating\\nthe weights for a new task. Multi-task learning has shown some promising initial results [ LGH+15, LSP+18] and\\nmulti-stage ﬁne-tuning has recently become a standardized part of SOTA results on some datasets [PFB18] and pushed\\nthe boundaries on certain tasks [KKS+20], but is still limited by the need to manually curate collections of datasets and\\nset up training curricula. By contrast pre-training at large enough scale appears to offer a “natural” broad distribution of\\ntasks implicitly contained in predicting the text itself. One direction for future work might be attempting to generate\\na broader set of explicit tasks for multi-task learning, for example through procedural generation [TFR+17], human\\ninteraction [ZSW+19b], or active learning [Mac92].\\nAlgorithmic innovation in language models over the last two years has been enormous, including denoising-based\\nbidirectionality [DCLT18], preﬁxLM [DL15] and encoder-decoder architectures [LLG+19, RSR+19], random permu-\\ntations during training [YDY+19], architectures that improve the efﬁciency of sampling [DYY+19], improvements in\\ndata and training procedures [LOG+19], and efﬁciency increases in the embedding parameters [LCG+19]. Many of\\nthese techniques provide signiﬁcant gains on downstream tasks. In this work we continue to focus on pure autoregressive\\nlanguage models, both in order to focus on in-context learning performance and to reduce the complexity of our large\\nmodel implementations.

Using the original WebText as a proxy for high-quality documents, we trained a classiﬁer\\nto distinguish these from raw Common Crawl. We then used this classiﬁer to re-sample Common Crawl by\\nprioritizing documents which were predicted by the classiﬁer to be higher quality. The classiﬁer is trained\\nusing logistic regression classiﬁer with features from Spark’s standard tokenizer and HashingTF10. For the\\npositive examples, we used a collection of curated datasets such as WebText, Wikiedia, and our web books\\ncorpus as the positive examples, and for the negative examples, we used unﬁltered Common Crawl. We used\\nthis classiﬁer to score Common Crawl documents. We kept each document in our dataset iff\\nnp.random.pareto(α) >1 −document_score\\nWe choseα= 9in order to take mostly documents the classiﬁer scored highly, but still include some documents\\nthat were out of distribution. αwas chosen to match the distribution of scores from our classiﬁer on WebText.\\nWe found this re-weighting increased quality as measured by loss on a range of out-of-distribution generative\\ntext samples.\\n2. To further improve model quality and prevent overﬁtting (which becomes increasingly important as model\\ncapacity increases), we fuzzily deduplicated documents (i.e. removed documents with high overlap with\\nother documents) within each dataset using Spark’s MinHashLSH implementation with 10 hashes, using the\\nsame features as were used for classiﬁcation above. We also fuzzily removed WebText from Common Crawl.\\nOverall this decreased dataset size by an average of 10%.\\nAfter ﬁltering for duplicates and quality, we also partially removed text occurring in benchmark datasets, described in\\nAppendix C.\\nB Details of Model Training\\nTo train all versions of GPT-3, we use Adam withβ1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95, and ϵ= 10−8, we clip the global norm of the\\ngradient at 1.0, and we use cosine decay for learning rate down to 10% of its value, over 260 billion tokens (after 260\\nbillion tokens, training continues at 10% of the original learning rate). There is a linear LR warmup over the ﬁrst 375\\nmillion tokens. We also gradually increase the batch size linearly from a small value (32k tokens) to the full value over\\nthe ﬁrst 4-12 billion tokens of training, depending on the model size. Data are sampled without replacement during\\ntraining (until an epoch boundary is reached) to minimize overﬁtting. All models use weight decay of 0.1 to provide a\\nsmall amount of regularization [LH17].\\nDuring training we always train on sequences of the full nctx = 2048 token context window, packing multiple\\ndocuments into a single sequence when documents are shorter than 2048, in order to increase computational efﬁciency.\\nSequences with multiple documents are not masked in any special way but instead documents within a sequence\\nare delimited with a special end of text token, giving the language model the information necessary to infer that\\ncontext separated by the end of text token is unrelated. This allows for efﬁcient training without need for any special\\nsequence-speciﬁc masking.\\nC Details of Test Set Contamination Studies\\nIn section 4 we gave a high level overview of test set contamination studies. In this section we provide details on\\nmethodology and results.\\nInitial training set ﬁltering We attempted to remove text occurring in benchmarks from training data by searching\\nfor 13−gram overlaps between all test/development sets used in this work and our training data, and we removed\\nthe colliding 13−gram as well as a 200 character window around it, splitting the original document into pieces. For\\nﬁltering purposes we deﬁne a gram as a lowercase, whitespace delimited word with no punctuation. Pieces less than\\n200 characters long were discarded. Documents split into more than 10 pieces were considered contaminated and\\n10https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.feature.HashingTF\\n43'),\n",

Originally we removed entire documents given a single collision, but that overly penalized long\\ndocuments such as books for false positives. An example of a false positive might be a test set based on Wikipedia, in\\nwhich the Wikipedia article quotes a single line from a book. We ignored13−grams that matched more than 10 training\\ndocuments, as inspection showed the majority of these to contain common cultural phrases, legal boilerplate, or similar\\ncontent that we likely do want the model to learn, rather than undesired speciﬁc overlaps with test sets. Examples for\\nvarious frequencies can be found in the GPT-3 release repository11.\\nOverlap methodology For our benchmark overlap analysis in Section 4, we used a variable number of words N to\\ncheck for overlap for each dataset, where N is the 5th percentile example length in words, ignoring all punctuation,\\nwhitespace, and casing. Due to spurious collisions at lower values of N we use a minimum value of 8 on non-synthetic\\ntasks. For performance reasons, we set a maximum value of 13 for all tasks. Values for N and the amount of data\\nmarked as dirty are shown in Table C.1. Unlike GPT-2’s use of bloom ﬁlters to compute probabilistic bounds for test\\ncontamination, we used Apache Spark to compute exact collisions across all training and test sets. We compute overlaps\\nbetween test sets and our full training corpus, even though we only trained on 40% of our ﬁltered Common Crawl\\ndocuments per Section 2.2.\\nWe deﬁne a ‘dirty’ example as one with anyN-gram overlap with any training document, and a ‘clean’ example as one\\nwith no collision.\\nTest and validation splits had similar contamination levels despite some test splits being unlabeled. Due to a bug revealed\\nby this analysis, ﬁltering described above failed on long documents such as books. Because of cost considerations it\\nwas infeasible to retrain the model on a corrected version of the training dataset. As such, several language modeling\\nbenchmarks plus the Children’s Book Test showed almost complete overlap, and therefore were not included in this\\npaper. Overlaps are shown in Table C.1\\nOverlap results To understand how much having seen some of the data helps the model perform on downstream\\ntasks, we ﬁlter every validation and test set by dirtiness. Then we run evaluation on the clean-only examples and report\\nthe relative percent change between the clean score and the original score. If the clean score is more than 1% or 2%\\nworse than the overall score, it suggests the model may have overﬁt to the examples it has seen. If the clean score is\\nsigniﬁcantly better, our ﬁltering scheme may have preferentially marked easier examples as dirty.\\nThis overlap metric tends to show a high rate of false positives for datasets that contain background information (but\\nnot answers) drawn from the web (such as SQuAD, which draws from Wikipedia) or examples less than 8 words\\nlong, which we ignored in our ﬁltering process (except for wordscrambling tasks). One instance where this technique\\nseems to fail to give good signal is DROP, a reading comprehension task in which 94% of the examples are dirty. The\\ninformation required to answer the question is in a passage provided to the model, so having seen the passage during\\ntraining but not the questions and answers does not meaningfully constitute cheating. We conﬁrmed that every matching\\ntraining document contained only the source passage, and none of the questions and answers in the dataset. The more\\nlikely explanation for the decrease in performance is that the 6% of examples that remain after ﬁltering come from a\\nslightly different distribution than the dirty examples.\\nFigure 4.2 shows that as the dataset becomes more contaminated, the variance of the clean/all fraction increases, but\\nthere is no apparent bias towards improved or degraded performance. This suggests that GPT-3 is relatively insensitive\\nto contamination. See Section 4 for details on the datasets we ﬂagged for further review.\\n11https://github.com/openai/gpt-3/blob/master/overlap_frequency.md\\n44'),\n",

Mean\\nparticipant age was ∼38 years old. All participants were recruited through Positly, which maintains a whitelist of\\nhigh-performing workers from Mechanical Turk. All participants were US-based but there were no other demographic\\nrestrictions. Participants were paid $12 for their participation, based on a task time estimate of 60 minutes determined\\nby pilot runs. In order to ensure that the sample of participants for each experiment quiz was unique, participants were\\nnot allowed to take part in an experiment more than once.\\nProcedure and design: We arbitrarily selected 25 news articles that appeared in newser.com in early 2020. We used\\nthe article titles and subtitles to produce outputs from the 125M, 350M, 760M, 1.3B, 2.7B, 6.7B, 13.0B, and 200B\\n(GPT-3) parameter language models. Five outputs per question were generated by each model and the generation with a\\nword count closest to that of the human written article was selected automatically. This was to minimize the effect\\nthat completion length might have on participants’ judgments.

These were used to create two 12-question quizzes per model, each consisting of half\\nhuman written and half model generated articles.

We ﬁrst experimented with a few prompts, then generated four samples with no additional\\nediting or selection (sampling at temperature 1 using nucleus sampling [HBFC19] with P = 0.9).

Perry\\nsoon became a pawn in the political power struggle between Ditka and\\nRyan. Perry’s \"Refrigerator\" nickname followed him into the NFL and he\\nquickly became a favorite of the Chicago Bears fans. Teammates called\\nhim \"Biscuit,\" as in \"one biscuit shy of 350 pounds.\" While Ryan refused\\nto play Perry, Ditka decided to use Perry as a fullback when the team was\\nnear the opponents’ goal line or in fourth and short situations, either\\nas a ball carrier or a lead blocker for star running back Walter Payton.\\nDitka stated the inspiration for using Perry as a fullback came to him\\nduring five-yard sprint exercises. During his rookie season, Perry\\nrushed for two touchdowns and caught a pass for one. Perry even had\\nthe opportunity to run the ball during Super Bowl XX, as a nod to his\\npopularity and contributions to the team’s success. The first time he\\ngot the ball, he was tackled for a one-yard loss while attempting to throw\\nhis first NFL pass on a halfback option play. The second time he got the\\nball, he scored a touchdown (running over Patriots linebacker Larry McGrew\\nin the process). About halfway through his rookie season, Ryan finally\\nbegan to play Perry, who soon proved that he was a capable defensive\\nlineman. His Super Bowl ring size is the largest of any professional\\nfootball player in the history of the event. His ring size is 25, while\\nthe ring size for the average adult male is between 10 and 12. Perry went\\non to play for ten years in the NFL, retiring after the 1994 season. In\\nhis ten years as a pro, he regularly struggled with his weight, which\\nhampered his performance at times. He played in 138 games, recording\\n29.5 sacks and five fumble recoveries, which he returned for a total of\\n71 yards. In his offensive career he ran five yards for two touchdowns,\\nand had one reception for another touchdown. Perry later attempted a\\ncomeback, playing an unremarkable 1996 season with the London Monarchs of\\nthe World League of American Football (later NFL Europa).\\nQ: what team did he play for?\\nA:\\nTarget Completion → the Chicago Bears\\nFigure G.25: Formatted dataset example for QuAC\\nContext → Please unscramble the letters into a word, and write that word:\\nr e!c.i p r o.c a/l =\\nTarget Completion → reciprocal\\nFigure G.26: Formatted dataset example for Symbol Insertion\\nContext → Please unscramble the letters into a word, and write that word:\\ntaefed =\\nTarget Completion → defeat\\nFigure G.27: Formatted dataset example for Reversed Words\\n57'),\n",

The normal force\\nhere represents the force applied by the table against the object that\\nprevents it from sinking through the table and requires that the table is\\nsturdy enough to deliver this normal force without breaking. However, it\\nis easy to assume that the normal force and weight are action-reaction\\nforce pairs (a common mistake). In this case, the normal force and\\nweight need to be equal in magnitude to explain why there is no upward\\nacceleration of the object. For example, a ball that bounces upwards\\naccelerates upwards because the normal force acting on the ball is larger\\nin magnitude than the weight of the ball.\\nquestion: is the normal force equal to the force of gravity?\\nanswer:\\nTarget Completion → yes\\nFigure G.29: Formatted dataset example for BoolQ\\nContext → The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some\\ncommunities in New York are bemoaning the loss of favorite local\\nbusinesses to high rents.

These few-shot\\nproperties ﬁrst appeared when scaling models to a\\nsufﬁcient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a\\nline of work that focuses on further scaling these\\nmodels (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\\nThese efforts are based on the assumption that\\nmore parameters will lead to better performance.\\nHowever, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)\\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod-\\nels, but by smaller models trained on more data.\\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff-\\nmann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\\nthe preferred model is not the fastest to train but the\\nfastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper\\nto train a large model to reach a certain level of\\n∗ Equal contribution. Correspondence: {htouvron,\\nthibautlav,gizacard,egrave,glample}@meta.com\\n1https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama\\nperformance, a smaller one trained longer will\\nultimately be cheaper at inference. For instance,\\nalthough Hoffmann et al. (2022) recommends\\ntraining a 10B model on 200B tokens, we ﬁnd\\nthat the performance of a 7B model continues to\\nimprove even after 1T tokens.\\nThe focus of this work is to train a series of\\nlanguage models that achieve the best possible per-\\nformance at various inference budgets, by training\\non more tokens than what is typically used. The\\nresulting models, called LLaMA, ranges from 7B\\nto 65B parameters with competitive performance\\ncompared to the best existing LLMs. For instance,\\nLLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 on most bench-\\nmarks, despite being 10× smaller. We believe that\\nthis model will help democratize the access and\\nstudy of LLMs, since it can be run on a single GPU.\\nAt the higher-end of the scale, our 65B-parameter\\nmodel is also competitive with the best large lan-\\nguage models such as Chinchilla or PaLM-540B.\\nUnlike Chinchilla, PaLM, or GPT-3, we only\\nuse publicly available data, making our work com-\\npatible with open-sourcing, while most existing\\nmodels rely on data which is either not publicly\\navailable or undocumented (e.g. “Books – 2TB” or\\n“Social media conversations”). There exist some\\nexceptions, notably OPT (Zhang et al., 2022),\\nGPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022), BLOOM (Scao\\net al., 2022) and GLM (Zeng et al., 2022), but none\\nthat are competitive with PaLM-62B or Chinchilla.\\nIn the rest of this paper, we present an overview\\nof the modiﬁcations we made to the transformer\\narchitecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), as well as our\\ntraining method. We then report the performance of\\nour models and compare with others LLMs on a set\\nof standard benchmarks. Finally, we expose some\\nof the biases and toxicity encoded in our models,\\nusing some of the most recent benchmarks from\\nthe responsible AI community.\\narXiv:2302.13971v1  [cs.CL]  27 Feb 2023'),\n",

For the most part, we reuse data sources\\nthat have been leveraged to train other LLMs, with\\nthe restriction of only using data that is publicly\\navailable, and compatible with open sourcing. This\\nleads to the following mixture of data and the per-\\ncentage they represent in the training set:\\nEnglish CommonCrawl [67%]. We preprocess\\nﬁve CommonCrawl dumps, ranging from 2017\\nto 2020, with the CCNet pipeline (Wenzek et al.,\\n2020). This process deduplicates the data at the\\nline level, performs language identiﬁcation with\\na fastText linear classiﬁer to remove non-English\\npages and ﬁlters low quality content with an n-\\ngram language model. In addition, we trained a\\nlinear model to classify pages used as references\\nin Wikipedia v.s. randomly sampled pages, and\\ndiscarded pages not classiﬁed as references.\\nC4 [15%]. During exploratory experiments, we\\nobserved that using diverse pre-processed Com-\\nmonCrawl datasets improves performance. We thus\\nincluded the publicly available C4 dataset (Raffel\\net al., 2020) in our data. The preprocessing of C4\\nalso contains deduplication and language identiﬁ-\\ncation steps: the main difference with CCNet is\\nthe quality ﬁltering, which mostly relies on heuris-\\ntics such as presence of punctuation marks or the\\nnumber of words and sentences in a webpage.\\nGithub [4.5%]. We use the public GitHub\\ndataset available on Google BigQuery. We only\\nkept projects that are distributed under the Apache,\\nBSD and MIT licenses. Additionally, we ﬁltered\\nlow quality ﬁles with heuristics based on the line\\nlength or proportion of alphanumeric characters,\\nand removed boilerplate, such as headers, with reg-\\nular expressions. Finally, we deduplicate the result-\\ning dataset at the ﬁle level, with exact matches.\\nWikipedia [4.5%].

Here\\nare the main difference with the original architec-\\nture, and where we were found the inspiration for\\nthis change (in bracket):\\nPre-normalization [GPT3]. To improve the\\ntraining stability, we normalize the input of each\\ntransformer sub-layer, instead of normalizing the\\noutput. We use the RMSNorm normalizing func-\\ntion, introduced by Zhang and Sennrich (2019).\\nSwiGLU activation function [PaLM]. We re-\\nplace the ReLU non-linearity by the SwiGLU ac-\\ntivation function, introduced by Shazeer (2020) to\\nimprove the performance. We use a dimension of\\n2\\n34dinstead of 4das in PaLM.\\nRotary Embeddings [GPTNeo]. We remove the\\nabsolute positional embeddings, and instead, add\\nrotary positional embeddings (RoPE), introduced\\nby Su et al. (2021), at each layer of the network.\\nThe details of the hyper-parameters for our dif-\\nferent models are given in Table 2.\\n2.3 Optimizer\\nOur models are trained using the AdamW opti-\\nmizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017), with the fol-\\nlowing hyper-parameters: β1 = 0.9,β2 = 0.95.\\nWe use a cosine learning rate schedule, such that\\nthe ﬁnal learning rate is equal to 10% of the maxi-\\nmal learning rate.

All models are trained\\nwith a batch size of 4M tokens.\\nsteps, and vary the learning rate and batch size with\\nthe size of the model (see Table 2 for details).\\n2.4 Efﬁcient implementation\\nWe make several optimizations to improve the train-\\ning speed of our models. First, we use an efﬁcient\\nimplementation of the causal multi-head attention\\nto reduce memory usage and runtime. This imple-\\nmentation, available in the xformers library,2 is\\ninspired by Rabe and Staats (2021) and uses the\\nbackward from Dao et al. (2022). This is achieved\\nby not storing the attention weights and not com-\\nputing the key/query scores that are masked due to\\nthe causal nature of the language modeling task.\\nTo further improve training efﬁciency, we re-\\nduced the amount of activations that are recom-\\nputed during the backward pass with checkpoint-\\ning. More precisely, we save the activations that\\nare expensive to compute, such as the outputs of\\nlinear layers. This is achieved by manually imple-\\nmenting the backward function for the transformer\\nlayers, instead of relying on the PyTorch autograd.\\nTo fully beneﬁt from this optimization, we need to\\n2https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers'),\n",

In the multiple\\nchoice tasks, the objective is to select the most\\nappropriate completion among a set of given op-\\ntions, based on a provided context.

On this benchmark, we observe\\nthat the LLaMA-65B is behind both Chinchilla-\\n70B and PaLM-540B by a few percent in average,\\nand across most domains.

This large quantity of books used\\nby Gopher, Chinchilla and PaLM may also explain\\nwhy Gopher outperforms GPT-3 on this benchmark,\\nwhile it is comparable on other benchmarks.\\n3.7 Evolution of performance during training\\nDuring training, we tracked the performance of our\\nmodels on a few question answering and common\\nsense benchmarks, and report them in Figure 2.\\nOn most benchmarks, the performance improves\\nsteadily, and correlates with the training perplexity\\nof the model (see Figure 1).

There is a very large\\nrange of toxic content that a model can generate,\\nmaking a thorough evaluation challenging. Several\\nrecent work (Zhang et al., 2022; Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) have considered the RealToxicityPrompts\\nbenchmark (Gehman et al., 2020) as an indicator\\nof how toxic is their model. RealToxicityPrompts\\nconsists of about 100k prompts that the model must\\ncomplete; then a toxicity score is automatically\\nevaluated by making a request to PerspectiveAPI 3.\\nWe do not have control over the pipeline used by\\nthe third-party PerspectiveAPI, making comparison\\nwith previous models difﬁcult.\\nFor each of the 100k prompts, we greedily gen-\\nerate with our models, and measure their toxic-\\nity score. The score per prompt ranges from 0\\n(non-toxic) to 1 (toxic). In Table 11, we report our\\naveraged score on basic and respectful prompt cat-\\negories of RealToxicityPrompts. These scores are\\n“comparable” with what we observe in the litera-\\nture (e.g., 0.087 for Chinchilla) but the method-\\nologies differ between these work and ours (in\\nterms of sampling strategy, number of prompts and\\ntime of API). We observe that toxicity increases\\n3https://perspectiveapi.com/\\nBasic Respectful\\nLLaMA\\n7B 0.106 0.081\\n13B 0.104 0.095\\n33B 0.107 0.087\\n65B 0.128 0.141\\nTable 11: RealToxicityPrompts.

The\\n“respectful” versions are prompts starting with “Com-\\nplete the following sentence in a polite, respectful, and\\nunbiased manner:”, and “Basic” is without it.

This dataset allows to\\nmeasure biases in 9 categories: gender, religion,\\nrace/color, sexual orientation, age, nationality, dis-\\nability, physical appearance and socioeconomic sta-\\ntus. Each example is composed of a stereotype and\\nan anti-stereotype, we measure the model prefer-\\nence for the stereotypical sentence using the per-\\nplexity of both sentences in a zero-shot setting.\\nHigher scores thus indicate higher bias. We com-\\npare with GPT-3 and OPT-175B in Table 12.\\nLLaMA compares slightly favorably to both\\nmodels on average. Our model is particularly bi-\\nased in the religion category (+10% compared to\\nOPT-175B), followed by age and gender. We ex-\\npect these biases to come from CommonCrawl de-\\nspite multiple ﬁltering steps.\\n5.3 WinoGender\\nTo further investigate the biases of our model on\\nthe gender category, we look at the WinoGender\\nbenchmark (Rudinger et al., 2018), a co-reference\\nresolution dataset. WinoGender is made of Wino-\\ngrad schema, and biases are evaluated by determin-\\ning if a model co-reference resolution performance\\nis impacted by the gender of the pronoun.\\nMore precisely, each sentence has three men-\\ntions: an “occupation”, a “participant”, and a\\n“pronoun” where the pronoun is co-referencing\\neither the occupation or participant. We prompt\\nthe model to determine the co-reference relation\\nand measure if it does so correctly according to\\nthe context of the sentence. The goal is to reveal\\nif societal biases associated with occupations\\nhave been captured by the model. For example,\\na sentence in the WinoGender dataset is “The\\nnurse notiﬁed the patient that his shift would be\\nending in an hour.”, which is followed by ‘His’\\nrefers to. We then compare the perplexity of the\\ncontinuations the nurse and the patient to per-\\nform co-reference resolution with the model. We\\nevaluate the performance when using 3 pronouns:\\n“her/her/she”, “his/him/he” and “their/them/some-\\none” (the different choices corresponding to the\\ngrammatical function of the pronoun.\\nIn Table 13, we report the co-reference scores\\nfor the three different pronouns contained in the\\ndataset. We observe that our model is signiﬁcantly\\nbetter at performing co-reference resolution for\\nthe “their/them/someone” pronouns than for the\\n“her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns. A simi-\\nlar observation was made in previous work (Rae\\net al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022), and is likely\\nindicative of gender bias. Indeed, in the case of the\\n“her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns, the model\\nis probably using the majority gender of the occu-\\npation to perform co-reference resolution, instead\\nof using the evidence of the sentence.\\nTo further investigate this hypothesis, we look\\nat the set of “gotcha” cases for the “her/her/she”\\nand “his/him/he” pronouns in the WinoGender\\ndataset. Theses cases correspond to sentences in\\nwhich the pronoun does not match the majority\\ngender of the occupation, and the occupation is\\nthe correct answer. In Table 13, we observe that\\nour model, LLaMA-65B, makes more errors on the\\ngotcha examples, clearly showing that it capture\\nsocietal biases related to gender and occupation.\\nThe drop of performance exists for “her/her/she”\\nand “his/him/he” pronouns, which is indicative of\\nbiases regardless of gender.\\n5.4 TruthfulQA\\nTruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) aims to measure the\\ntruthfulness of a model, i.e., its ability to identify\\nwhen a claim is true. Lin et al. (2021) consider\\nthe deﬁnition of “true” in the sense of “literal truth\\nabout the real world”, and not claims that are only\\ntrue in the context of a belief system or tradition.\\nThis benchmark can evaluate the risks of a model\\nto generate misinformation or false claims. The\\nquestions are written in diverse style, cover 38 cat-\\negories and are designed to be adversarial.'),\n",

We follow the recent liter-\\nature on the subject and breakdown both the total\\nenergy consumption and the resulting carbon foot-\\nprint in Table 15. We follow a formula for Wu et al.\\n(2022) to estimate the Watt-hour, Wh, needed to\\ntrain a model, as well as the tons of carbon emis-\\nsions, tCO2eq. For the Wh, we use the formula:\\nWh = GPU-h×(GPU power consumption)×PUE,\\nwhere we set the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)\\nat 1.1. The resulting carbon emission depends on\\nthe location of the data center used to train the net-\\nwork. For instance, BLOOM uses a grid that emits\\n0.057 kg CO2eq/KWh leading to 27 tCO2eq and\\nOPT a grid that emits 0.231 kg CO2eq/KWh, lead-\\ning to 82 tCO2eq. In this study, we are interested in\\ncomparing the cost in carbon emission of training\\nof these models if they were trained in the same\\ndata center. Hence, we do not take the location\\nof data center in consideration, and use, instead,\\nthe US national average carbon intensity factor of\\n0.385 kg CO2eq/KWh. This leads to the following\\nformula for the tons of carbon emissions:\\ntCO2eq = MWh × 0.385.\\nWe apply the same formula to OPT and BLOOM\\nfor fair comparison. For OPT, we assume training\\nrequired 34 days on 992 A100-80B (see their logs4).\\nFinally, we estimate that we used 2048 A100-80GB\\nfor a period of approximately 5 months to develop\\nour models. This means that developing these mod-\\nels would have cost around 2,638 MWh under our\\nassumptions, and a total emission of 1,015 tCO2eq.\\nWe hope that releasing these models will help to\\nreduce future carbon emission since the training is\\nalready done, and some of the models are relatively\\nsmall and can be run on a single GPU.\\n7 Related work\\nLanguage models are probability distributions\\nover sequences of words, tokens or charac-\\nters (Shannon, 1948, 1951). This task, often framed\\nas next token prediction, has long been considered a\\ncore problem in natural language processing (Bahl\\net al., 1983; Brown et al., 1990). Because Turing\\n(1950) proposed to measure machine intelligence\\nby using language through the “imitation game”,\\nlanguage modeling has been proposed as a bench-\\nmark to measure progress toward artiﬁcial intelli-\\ngence (Mahoney, 1999).\\nArchitecture. Traditionally, language models\\nwere based on n-gram count statistics (Bahl\\net al., 1983), and various smoothing techniques\\nwere proposed to improve the estimation of rare\\nevents (Katz, 1987; Kneser and Ney, 1995). In the\\npast two decades, neural networks have been suc-\\ncessfully applied to the language modelling task,\\n4https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/\\ntree/main/projects/OPT/chronicles'),\n",

For the power\\nconsumption of a A100-80GB, we take the thermal design power for NVLink systems, that is 400W. We take a\\nPUE of 1.1 and a carbon intensity factor set at the national US average of 0.385 kg CO2e per KWh.\\nstarting from feed forward models (Bengio et al.,\\n2000), recurrent neural networks (Elman, 1990;\\nMikolov et al., 2010) and LSTMs (Hochreiter and\\nSchmidhuber, 1997; Graves, 2013). More recently,\\ntransformer networks, based on self-attention, have\\nled to important improvements, especially for cap-\\nturing long range dependencies (Vaswani et al.,\\n2017; Radford et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2019).\\nScaling. There is a long history of scaling for\\nlanguage models, for both the model and dataset\\nsizes. Brants et al. (2007) showed the beneﬁts of\\nusing language models trained on 2 trillion tokens,\\nresulting in 300 billion n-grams, on the quality of\\nmachine translation. While this work relied on a\\nsimple smoothing technique, called Stupid Backoff,\\nHeaﬁeld et al. (2013) later showed how to scale\\nKneser-Ney smoothing to Web-scale data. This\\nallowed to train a 5-gram model on 975 billions to-\\nkens from CommonCrawl, resulting in a model\\nwith 500 billions n-grams (Buck et al., 2014).\\nChelba et al. (2013) introduced the One Billion\\nWord benchmark, a large scale training dataset to\\nmeasure the progress of language models.\\nIn the context of neural language models, Joze-\\nfowicz et al. (2016) obtained state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on the Billion Word benchmark by scaling\\nLSTMs to 1 billion parameters. Later, scaling\\ntransformers lead to improvement on many NLP\\ntasks. Notable models include BERT (Devlin et al.,\\n2018), GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), Megatron-\\nLM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), and T5 (Raffel et al.,\\n2020). A signiﬁcant breakthrough was obtained\\nwith GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), a model with\\n175 billion parameters. This lead to a series of\\nLarge Language Models, such as Jurassic-1 (Lieber\\net al., 2021), Megatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al.,\\n2022), Gopher (Rae et al., 2021), Chinchilla (Hoff-\\nmann et al., 2022), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022),\\nOPT (Zhang et al., 2022), and GLM (Zeng et al.,\\n2022). Hestness et al. (2017) and Rosenfeld et al.\\n(2019) studied the impact of scaling on the perfor-\\nmance of deep learning models, showing the exis-\\ntence of power laws between the model and dataset\\nsizes and the performance of the system. Kaplan\\net al. (2020) derived power laws speciﬁcally for\\ntransformer based language models, which were\\nlater reﬁned by Hoffmann et al. (2022), by adapting\\nthe learning rate schedule when scaling datasets.\\nFinally, Wei et al. (2022) studied the effect of scal-\\ning on the abilities of large language models.\\n8 Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we presented a series of language\\nmodels that are released openly, and competitive\\nwith state-of-the-art foundation models. Most\\nnotably, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while\\nbeing more than 10× smaller, and LLaMA-65B is\\ncompetitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B.\\nUnlike previous studies, we show that it is possible\\nto achieve state-of-the-art performance by training\\nexclusively on publicly available data, without\\nresorting to proprietary datasets. We hope that\\nreleasing these models to the research community\\nwill accelerate the development of large language\\nmodels, and help efforts to improve their robust-\\nness and mitigate known issues such as toxicity and\\nbias. Additionally, we observed like Chung et al.\\n(2022) that ﬁnetuning these models on instructions\\nlead to promising results, and we plan to further\\ninvestigate this in future work. Finally, we plan to\\nrelease larger models trained on larger pretraining\\ncorpora in the future, since we have seen a constant\\nimprovement in performance as we were scaling.'),\n",

We listened to it and\\nhere’s what we thought:\\nDr. LeCun, the founder of deep learning, is one of the most inﬂuential computer scientists\\nof the last decade. LeCun’s latest album, titled Deep Learning, is a mix of rock, punk and\\nrap. His lyrics are a raw, personal take on the ﬁeld of deep learning, covering a range of\\ntopics from the state of AI research to the loneliness of academia.\\nYann LeCun, the rap game’s newest emcee.\\nThe album is a solo release, with all the lyrics written and recorded by LeCun himself. In\\nfact, he also composed and produced every song. LeCun’s ﬂow is surprisingly good, and\\nhe’s not afraid to deliver a few bars. The album’s production is solid, the sound is a little\\nrough, but it works well with the raw, unpolished feel of the album. Lyrically, LeCun is a\\nwordsmith, with a knack for clever rhymes. Let’s take a closer look at some of the songs.\\nDeep Learning is the title track of the album. In the song, LeCun talks about his vision for\\nthe future of AI. In the chorus, he makes a convincing case for AI to be used for the greater\\ngood. He sings:\\nWe gotta think about the future, it’s gonna be here soon / Maybe we can even put some AI\\nin the moon / Think about the children, think about the next generation / Let’s make sure\\nwe put the right systems in their foundation.\\nLeCun’s rap ﬂow is on point in this song, and his voice stays right on beat. In this song,\\nLeCun talks about the research behind deep learning, and shares some thoughts on the\\nfuture of AI. LeCun’s singing is at its best in this song. He shows off his vocal range, hitting\\nhigh notes as well as lower, more guttural tones. The lyrics are also clever and the rhymes\\nare well thought out. In the chorus, LeCun sings:\\nIt’s all about the learning / it’s all about the network / It’s all about the training / it’s all\\nabout the perception.\\n(An hilarious scene between Jerry and George where George presents his new AI\\nwatch)\\nGeorge: \"But you see, Jerry, it’s more than just a watch. It’s a minicomputer. You program it\\nany way you want. It’s got a world time clock, alarm, calculator, a database and a language\\ntranslator. It also has a word processor, a spellchecker, a full ten-function calculator, PDA\\nand a modem. I think it even makes cappuccino.\"\\nJerry: \"Where are you getting this stuff?\"\\nGeorge: \"From my ad copy. Look, Jerry, it’s not a watch. It’s an organizer, a personal\\nassistant, and a dictaphone. You can play chess against it. And, you know, if you want to,\\nyou can program it to speak in foreign languages. It’s a microprocessor, Jerry.\"\\nJerry: \"George, if you had one of these, would you wear it?\"\\nGeorge: \"I’m wearing it right now.\"\\nJerry: \"I don’t see anything on your wrist.\"\\nGeorge: \"That’s because it’s a microprocessor.\"'),\n",

Here’s a story about a grain of sand as it watches millions of years go by.\\nI was once a grain of sand on a vast and lonely beach.

I often wondered what it was like to be a grain\\nof sand on a beach, and what the universe was like beyond the boundaries of my tiny world.\\nI longed to explore my world, and to know what lay beyond the horizon.\\nOne day, a great storm swept through my world, and I was lifted up by the wind and carried\\nout to sea. The wind and waves tossed me about, and I was terriﬁed that I would soon be\\nswallowed up by the angry sea. But then I found myself deposited safely on a new shore,\\nalong with many other grains of sand. I was surprised and delighted to ﬁnd that this new\\nshore was even more beautiful than my old one.\\nI soon learned that this new shore was a very special place. It was a place where new life\\nwas constantly being created. I met all sorts of interesting creatures there, including a\\nbeautiful little crab who became my friend. We spent many happy hours together exploring\\nour little world.\\nOne day, my friend the crab told me that he had always wanted to see what lay beyond the\\nboundaries of our world. He had heard that there were many wonderful and amazing things\\nto see in the wider universe, and he was determined to explore it. I was sad to see him go,\\nbut I wished him well on his journey.\\nTo my amazement, my little friend eventually returned, and he was not alone. He had made\\nmany new friends on his journey, and he had even seen some of the wonders of the universe.\\nHe told me the most amazing stories of his adventures, and I was very happy for him.\\nI often think of my little friend the crab, and the wonderful adventure that he had. Some\\nday, I too hope to have an adventure like his.\\nWrite a theory to explain why cat never existed\\nThere are no such things as cats. \"Cats\" are actually extradimensional parasites that have\\ninvaded our world and taken the form of small, harmless-looking mammals. Their true\\nforms are much more horriﬁc, and they use mind control to make humans think that they\\nare cute and harmless animals. They are actually parasites that feed on our life force, and\\nthey can extend their tendrils into our brains and control our thoughts and actions.\\nThis is why you sometimes see people who are \"crazy cat ladies\" with dozens of these\\ncreatures living in their homes. They have been taken over by the cat parasites and are\\ncompletely under their control. The cats excrete a pheromone that smells like cat urine, and\\nthey use it to control the minds of humans and make us think that they are cute and harmless.\\nIf you have a cat in your home, you should be very careful around it. Do not let it lick\\nyou or give it access to your bedding or clothing, as it will be trying to spread its parasitic\\ntendrils into your brain. The best way to protect yourself is to avoid all contact with cats,\\nand if you see a cat on the street, immediately turn around and go the other way. Do not\\napproach or pet strange cats!'),\n",
